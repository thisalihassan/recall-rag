["## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=0s)\n- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ([HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)) involves increased atmospheric pressure and increased inspired oxygen.\n- Oxygen is essential for energy production and is carried by red blood cells.\n- Oxygen-carrying capacity is limited by the number of red blood cells and the amount of oxygen they can carry.\n- HBOT can increase oxygen in circulation by driving more oxygen into the plasma or liquid of the bloodstream.\n- This can result in up to 1,200% more oxygen in circulation.\n## Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) for Improved Performance [(00:04:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=247s)\n- After exiting a hyperbaric chamber, there's a 30-minute window where the body has 1200% more oxygen in circulation.\n- Athletes can use this increased oxygen capacity to train harder and longer, delaying the onset of lactic acidosis.\n- Some athletes, including tennis players, use hyperbaric chambers before competitions to enhance their performance.\n- HBOT can also aid in recovery after exercise by facilitating the body's natural recovery processes.\n## 5 Benefits of HBOT [(00:05:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=350s)\n- Reverses low oxygen states, saving tissue in cases of acute trauma, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke, heart attack, or spinal cord injury.\n- Decreases inflammation and swelling, aiding in the healing process.\n- Improves immune system function, accelerating healing by 30-70% compared to regular healing.\n- Stimulates stem cell release, promoting the creation of new tissue, including brain, heart, and muscle tissue.\n- Helps with infections that do not thrive in high oxygen environments.\n## Does HBOT Blunt the Benefits of Exercise? [(00:08:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=482s)\n- Hyperbaric therapy ([HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)) is a hormetic stress that creates oxidative stress and shifts epigenetics.\n- Using HBOT immediately after exercise may blunt the body's natural adaptation to exercise.\n- HBOT can be used 3-4 hours after exercise to aid in recovery.\n- [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) improves blood flow and lymphatic flow, aiding in detoxification.\n- HBOT can be used before exercise to increase oxygen-carrying capacity.\n- HBOT may delay the lactate threshold, allowing for more work and greater adaptation.\n- These benefits have been observed in athletes but lack extensive scientific studies.\n## Improvement in Vo2max [(00:11:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=680s)\n- Hyperbaric therapy increases V2 Max, which is a longevity marker.\n- Hyperbaric therapy reverses low oxygen states by shifting expression of genes responsible for increasing blood vascular growth.\n- Hyperbaric therapy creates new blood vessels in the brain, heart, genital region, and other parts of the body.\n- Increased blood vascular density in the heart allows for sustained tissue and increased capacity to maintain blood flow, preventing lactic acidosis and allowing for improved performance.\n## More Blood Flow & Collagen Production (skin health) [(00:13:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=791s)\n- Hyperbaric therapy can increase collagen production.\n- Hyperbaric therapy increases the cells that help build up bone.\n- Hyperbaric therapy improves vascularization in tough-to-reach tissues like cartilage.\n- Hyperbaric therapy is most effective when combined with other interventions for cartilage production, such as peptides, [PRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-rich_plasma), or stem cell injections.\n- Hyperbaric therapy can improve skin hydration and appearance, giving it a more youthful look.\n- Hyperbaric therapy has the potential to increase longevity and healthspan.\n## Effect of HBOT on Healthspan & Mitochondria [(00:15:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=945s)\n- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ([HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)) improves mitochondrial health, promoting longevity and recovery.\n- HBOT stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, rebuilding new mitochondria and reducing senescent cells associated with degeneration and cancer.\n- HBOT regenerates mitochondrial function, promoting cellular renewal and allowing cells to sense when they need to die and be replaced.\n- [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) works through epigenetic mechanisms to influence gene expression, promoting growth, reducing apoptosis, stimulating new blood vessel formation, and decreasing inflammation.\n- Longer HBOT protocols (e.g., 5 days a week for several weeks) provide both immediate benefits during therapy (e.g., reduced inflammation, stem cell activation) and long-term benefits (e.g., epigenetic shifts, sustained reduction in inflammatory markers, improved wound healing).\n## Effect on Sleep & the Glymphatic System [(00:22:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=1338s)\n- Hyperbaric therapy infuses oxygen into all fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, increasing oxygen delivery to brain cells.\n- Increased energy production in brain cells leads to the need for waste removal.\n- Hyperbaric therapy creates a micro-massage effect on blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and glymphatic vessels, enhancing the movement of waste products out of cells and into the lymphatic system for detoxification.\n- Pressure, a crucial aspect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, improves lymphatic flow and energy production in mitochondria, even without additional oxygen.\n- Clinical experience suggests that hyperbaric therapy a few hours before bedtime improves sleep scores, recovery scores, HRV, and deep sleep, allowing athletes to achieve the same level of recovery with less sleep.\n## HBOT & Keto [(00:25:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=1524s)\n- Hyperbaric therapy (HBOT) can be combined with a ketogenic diet for various benefits.\n- As we age, our brains become less efficient at using glucose for energy, but our ability to use ketones remains the same.\n- [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) combined with a low-carb or keto diet can significantly improve energy production in individuals with brain injuries, Alzheimer's disease, or cognitive impairment.\n- Ketones protect the brain from oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, reducing the risk of seizures during HBOT.\n- For individuals with brain-related issues, a ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet combined with exogenous ketones is recommended during HBOT.\n## When to Use (and not use) HBOT [(00:27:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=1627s)\n- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ([HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)) can reduce inflammation, promote stem cell production, stimulate new blood vessel growth, and enhance lymphatic flow, making it beneficial for longevity and optimal health.\n- Individuals under significant stress, overtraining, or with chronic infections or autoimmunity should consult a professional before undergoing HBOT due to potential negative effects.\n- Pregnant women, individuals with a fever, lung disease, empyema, or those requiring oxygen should avoid HBOT due to potential risks.\n- Consulting with a knowledgeable professional before undergoing [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) is recommended to ensure safety and determine appropriate protocols.\n- HBOT can cause ear pressure changes similar to those experienced during air travel, and nasal congestion can make it harder to clear pressure in the chamber, so it's best to avoid HBOT if congested.\n- For athletes, using [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) during de-loading weeks with milder pressures (1.3 atmospheres) can aid in recovery, while deeper pressures (above 1.7 atmospheres) should be used cautiously during heavy training weeks to avoid excessive oxidative stress.\n- HBOT is generally more beneficial for recovery rather than immediately before intense workouts, but one-off HBOT sessions can be helpful before short, intense workouts or maximal lifts.\n## Where to Get Your Hands on a Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber | OneBase [(00:34:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onILjIlPCRA&t=2058s)\n- Dr. Scott Sherr created OneBase Health, a company that provides hyperbaric oxygen chambers and an ecosystem of support, including education, protocols, and a phone application.\n- OneBase Health ensures that their chambers have safety measures and protocols in place.\n- The company offers consultations to help people understand how to use hyperbaric oxygen therapy effectively.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMnvwYBbc5Q&t=0s)\n- The concept of the [Blue Zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_zone) originated from a meeting in [Montpelier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpelier,_Vermont), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), where a researcher identified five areas with the longest-living populations.\n- Journalist [Dan Buettner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Buettner) popularized the Blue Zones concept, but his interpretation may be biased towards supporting a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle.\n- The actual [Okinawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Island) diet was documented by the US military after [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), and birth records were destroyed during Allied bombing, leading to uncertainties in age reporting.\n## Helix Sleep [(00:02:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMnvwYBbc5Q&t=161s)\n- Helix Sleep is offering a 25% discount on premium mattresses with two free pillows.\n- Dr. [Gundry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gundry) has been using his Helix mattress for over two years and highly recommends it.\n## Grains & Beans are Essential [(00:02:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMnvwYBbc5Q&t=177s)\n- The [Okinawans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_people), who live in one of the Blue Zones, do not eat grains and beans as staples.\n- Their diet primarily consists of sweet potatoes, spicy vegetables, and bitter greens.\n- Sweet potatoes are beneficial for maintaining a healthy microbiome.\n## There are no Smokers [(00:06:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMnvwYBbc5Q&t=388s)\n- In [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia), another [Blue Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_zone), the men who live in the mountainous areas have a longer lifespan than the women.\n- Despite being smokers, the men's longevity is attributed to the nicotine in the smoke.\n- The [Sardinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_people) also consume a significant amount of sheep and goat cheeses and yogurts, which contribute to their longevity.\n## Sardinia vs Other Mediterranean Regions [(00:07:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMnvwYBbc5Q&t=468s)\n- Sardinia has the lowest carbohydrate consumption (35%) compared to other [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_cuisine) regions (60%).\n- Sardinians drink [Cannonau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenache) wine, which has high levels of polyphenols, especially when grown at higher altitudes.\n- Polyphenols protect plants from UV damage and are used to uncouple mitochondria.\n- Olive oil from Moroccan desert has 30 times more polyphenols due to being planted in rocky soil and high elevation.\n- Atoli has the highest number of centenarians per population.\n- People in Atoli eat a lot of anchovies, olive oil, and wine.\n- They do not eat bread or pasta due to historical affordability.\n- Lentils are their primary source of carbohydrates.\n- [Rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary), which contains yolic acid and rosem marinic acid, is commonly consumed and has brain-boosting and aphrodisiac effects.\n- Despite not meeting the typical criteria for health, Atoli is a longevity capital of the world.\n- [Loma Linda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loma_Linda,_California) is not unique for longevity, but the [Adventist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church) diet within Loma Linda contributes to the city's longevity.\n- 50% of Adventists follow a plant-based diet, which contributes to their longevity.\n## High Fat Intake is Bad [(00:11:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMnvwYBbc5Q&t=704s)\n- The longest-living populations, such as goat and sheep herders in Sardinia, [Andorra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra), and the [Nicoya Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicoya_Peninsula), consume a diet rich in dairy products, particularly fermented sources like parmesan cheese.\n- Grains and beans may have negative effects, but these can be balanced by positive dietary factors like olive oil, polyphenols, and wine.\n- Smoking, despite its health risks, has been linked to a lower incidence of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's in long-living populations, suggesting potential benefits of nicotine.\n- Cities like [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong), with diverse cuisine, also have high life expectancies, challenging the idea that specific foods or diets alone determine longevity.\n- The longest-living countries do not necessarily have the best healthcare systems, as seen in Monaco, where wealth and other factors may contribute to longevity.\n## Healthcare & Longevity [(00:18:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMnvwYBbc5Q&t=1118s)\n- There is no direct correlation between healthcare spending and longevity.\n- Monaco, which has a high life expectancy, follows an Italian diet.\n- Olive oil consumption is linked to longevity in the Mediterranean region.\n- Olive oil is not the sole contributor to longevity in countries with long-living populations.\n- The polyphenol content of olive oil, not just its presence, is crucial for health benefits.\n- Sunlight exposure and vitamin D levels may be significant determinants of longevity.\n- Blue zones, or \"white zones,\" with high sunlight exposure tend to have longer-living populations.\n- A diet rich in olive oil and leafy greens is recommended for longevity.\n- Perilla oil, derived from perilla seeds, is considered equal or superior to olive oil.\n- Perilla oil is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a short-chain omega-3 fat.\n- The Leon Heart Diet study showed improved outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease who consumed a Mediterranean diet supplemented with perilla oil.\n- The only differential factor between the diets was the level of alpha-linolenic acid.\n- Alpha-linolenic acid correlates with blood vessel health and prevents lipopolysaccharides ([LPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipopolysaccharide)) from entering the bloodstream.\n- [Mastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastic_(plant_resin)) oil, found in [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia), has a high oleic acid content.\n- It may not have as high a polyphenol content as olive oil.\n## Where to Find More of Dr. Gundry's Content [(00:25:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMnvwYBbc5Q&t=1545s)\n- Dr. Gundry's book can be found at bookstores like [Barnes & Noble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_&_Noble), [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)), [Target](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation), and local booksellers.\n- You can also find Dr. [Gundry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gundry) online at DrGundry.com, GundryMD.com, the Dr. Gundry podcast, and his two [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) channels.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=0s)\n- Dr. [Mark Hyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hyman_(doctor)), a leading expert in functional medicine, advises against consuming current dairy products due to their problematic nature.\n- The obesity problem lacks effective solutions, making weight loss interventions like Ozempic highly appealing despite concerning side effects.\n- The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction, affecting 93% of the population, contributes to mental health issues, depression, anxiety, gun violence, and causes 11 million deaths annually.\n- These problems are not inevitable, as demonstrated by a child with severe ADD who experienced significant improvement after dietary changes.\n- Willpower alone is insufficient in controlling food behavior; education is crucial.\n- Consuming sugar in the morning, such as in cereals, pancakes, or bagels, is detrimental to health.\n- Regular strength training, three times a week for 20 minutes, is essential for longevity.\n- The \"five FS\" are key to achieving health, but most people do the opposite.\n- The podcast host encourages listeners to subscribe to the channel for better guests and more informative content.\n- Milk consumption has been linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, including prostate cancer and breast cancer.\n- The hormones and growth factors present in milk, particularly in conventional dairy products, are believed to contribute to cancer development.\n- Organic milk may have a lower risk, but it's still advisable to limit milk intake and opt for plant-based alternatives.\n- Ozempic, a medication used for type 2 diabetes, has gained popularity for its off-label use in weight loss.\n- While effective in promoting weight loss, Ozempic carries significant side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.\n- More concerningly, Ozempic has been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, and thyroid cancer.\n- The long-term effects of Ozempic are still unknown, and it's crucial to weigh the risks and benefits before considering its use for weight loss.\n## What Is Your Mission What’s Functional Medicine? [(00:02:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=126s)\n- Functional medicine is a new way of thinking about chronic diseases.\n- It focuses on root causes and sees the body as a system or network.\n- It aims to create health by identifying and removing impediments to health and providing the necessary ingredients for health.\n- Functional medicine recognizes that one cause can create many diseases and one disease can have many causes.\n- It uses a personalized approach to diagnosis and treatment, considering multiple factors and interventions.\n- Milk and dairy products have been linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, including prostate cancer and breast cancer.\n- The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it may be related to the hormones and growth factors present in milk.\n- Some studies have found that consuming milk and dairy products can increase the levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the body, which has been linked to an increased risk of cancer.\n- Other studies have suggested that the hormones in milk, such as estrogen and progesterone, may play a role in the development of certain cancers.\n- It is important to note that these studies are observational and do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. More research is needed to fully understand the link between milk and cancer.\n## I Couldn’t Function Properly, My Health Deteriorated Massively. [(00:06:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=389s)\n- The speaker's interest in health and helping people was influenced by experiences such as visiting a health resort and studying [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism).\n- After returning from [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), the speaker developed chronic fatigue syndrome and discovered functional medicine, which focuses on understanding biology on a cellular level and reversing health issues.\n- Using functional medicine principles, the speaker successfully treated patients with various conditions, including autoimmune diseases, migraines, diabetes, autism, and ADD.\n- The speaker emphasizes optimizing nutrition, removing harmful substances, and addressing gut health to achieve significant improvements in patients' health.\n- The speaker's passion is to alleviate unnecessary suffering caused by chronic diseases that burden healthcare systems.\n- The speaker attributes the rise in chronic diseases to changes in diet, environmental toxins, microbiome disruption, and nutritional deficiencies caused by ultra-processed foods.\n- Recognizing that curing diabetes in his office was insufficient, the speaker wrote a book called \"Food Fix\" and established a nonprofit organization to advocate for changes in food policies, including child-friendly labeling, medically tailored meals, nutrition education, dietary guidelines, and healthier options through food assistance programs.\n## The Food System Is Damaging Our Health. [(00:13:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=786s)\n- The current food system in [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) is damaging our health.\n- 90.3% of [Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans) have some metabolic dysfunction due to the food we produce, how it's grown, processed, marketed, and sold.\n- It's difficult to stay healthy in America due to the abundance of ultra-processed, addictive, and enticing food-like substances.\n- Eliminate all ultra-processed foods from your diet.\n- Think of ultra-processed foods as rocks, not food.\n- Cook your own food and bring snacks with you to avoid food emergencies.\n- Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time, just like you would plan for a trip.\n## The Primitive Instinct That Make You Eat Junk Food. [(00:16:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=982s)\n- When hungry, especially late at night, the logical part of the brain is less active, while the emotional part that seeks dopamine is more active.\n- This explains why people are more likely to make poor food choices when hungry and tired.\n- Willpower alone is not enough to control food behavior as it is driven by the ancestral evolutionary brain.\n- When blood sugar drops, the body goes into a life-threatening emergency mode and will consume whatever food is available, regardless of nutritional value.\n- Lack of proper food, sleep deprivation, and stress increase appetite, cortisol, and ghrelin, a hunger hormone, leading to cravings for carbs and sugar.\n## How to Stay Healthy in Today's Unhealthy World. [(00:18:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=1104s)\n- Education plays a significant role in health disparities, as seen in the case of a family from __Easley, [South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina)__, who participated in a film about childhood obesity and the food system.\n- Despite their efforts to eat low-fat and diet foods, their diet primarily consisted of packaged, processed foods high in high fructose corn syrup and trans fats.\n- [Mark Hyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hyman_(doctor)), the speaker, visited their home and demonstrated how to prepare a simple, healthy meal using affordable ingredients, resulting in a positive change in their eating habits.\n- Eating real food, rather than ultra-processed food, can lead to significant weight loss and health improvements, even in challenging circumstances.\n- Ultra-processed food is linked to various health issues, including obesity, diabetes, mental health problems, and cognitive decline.\n- There is a need for education and political will to change policies that promote the consumption of unhealthy foods, such as the proposed bill in Congress to limit ultra-processed food for kids with food stamps, which faces strong opposition from the food industry.\n## Is Milk Good for Us? [(00:24:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=1461s)\n- Milk was once believed to promote growth and strong bones, but scientific evidence does not support these claims.\n- The dairy industry has a significant influence on the promotion of milk consumption, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting its health benefits.\n- The US government previously promoted milk consumption through ads and school lunch programs, but these efforts were discontinued due to the lack of evidence supporting milk's health benefits.\n- Milk consumption has been linked to weight gain, cancer, digestive issues, autoimmune diseases, and allergies.\n- Ozempic is a once-weekly injectable medication used for type 2 diabetes.\n- It works by increasing insulin production and decreasing glucagon production, leading to lower blood sugar levels.\n- Ozempic can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and headache.\n- It can also cause serious side effects such as pancreatitis, gallbladder problems, kidney problems, and allergic reactions.\n- Ozempic should not be used by people with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, or diabetic retinopathy.\n- It should also not be used by people with severe kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.\n## Are There Health Benefits to It? [(00:27:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=1674s)\n- Modern milk comes from cows that are mostly homogenized and have limited genetic stock, known as A1 cows.\n- A1 casein, found in most modern milk, can cause inflammation and gut issues.\n- Sheep and goat milk, as well as certain cows like Jersey or [Guernsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey) cows, have A2 casein, which is less problematic.\n- Pasteurization, homogenization, and the addition of growth hormones and antibiotics to modern milk make it less desirable for consumption.\n- Consuming large amounts of dairy, especially conventional dairy, is not recommended due to potential health risks.\n- Some individuals may tolerate certain types of dairy, such as sheep milk, goat milk, or A2 milk from cows, and yogurt, depending on their genetics and sensitivities.\n## Ozmepic Drugs, Are They Good? [(00:29:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=1789s)\n- Ozempic ([semaglutide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide)) is a once-weekly injectable drug used for weight loss that works by regulating insulin function, weight, and appetite through the [GLP-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLP-1_receptor_agonist) pathway.\n- Despite its effectiveness in weight loss, Ozempic has several drawbacks, including its high cost (ranging from $13 to $1,700 per month), the return of weight gain after discontinuation unless significant lifestyle changes are made, and the lack of promotion of behavior or habit changes.\n- Ozempic can cause muscle loss, negatively impacting metabolism, longevity, and overall health, requiring users to increase protein intake and engage in weight training to mitigate this side effect.\n- The drug carries serious side effects such as an increased risk of bowel obstruction (450%) and pancreatitis (900%) due to its impact on the gut and metabolic functions.\n- Weight gain and obesity are not solely caused by a deficiency of GLP-1 but rather by a combination of factors such as environmental toxins, lifestyle, food systems, lack of exercise, and toxic environments.\n- Addressing the root causes of obesity requires policy changes, rethinking agricultural and food systems, and widespread education on healthy eating.\n- The high cost of Ozempic is expected to decrease as more companies release similar drugs, leading to increased competition and lower prices.\n- Insurance coverage for Ozempic is limited, with some insurance companies covering it for diabetic patients but not for non-approved indications.\n- Concerns have been raised about the potential risks of administering Ozempic to children as young as 5 years old.\n- The speaker emphasizes that there are potential trade-offs associated with using Ozempic and suggests that it should be reserved for severely obese individuals with severe health conditions who are struggling to lose weight, rather than being prescribed to everyone who wants to lose weight for cosmetic reasons.\n## Fruit [(00:39:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=2368s)\n- The effect of fruit on blood sugar varies depending on the individual's metabolic health.\n- Different fruits have different effects on blood sugar levels.\n- Fruit juice is linked to obesity and other health issues.\n- Whole fruits are generally fine to consume, but should not be eaten first thing in the morning.\n- Protein and fat in the morning are important for activating metabolism and protein synthesis.\n## When Should We Eat? [(00:40:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=2453s)\n- People should give themselves a break of 12-14 hours between dinner and breakfast to allow the body to repair and regenerate.\n- Eating sugary foods and drinks in the morning can disrupt the body's natural healing processes.\n- Processed foods, high sugar, and starch can disrupt the body's nutrient-sensing systems.\n## Evolutionary Story Behind Fasting. [(00:42:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=2565s)\n- Our ancestors had to hunt and gather for food, which meant they often experienced periods of feast and famine.\n- The body has a built-in system of conservation and repair that is activated during periods of fasting.\n- Fasting improves blood sugar control, recruits and builds new mitochondria, reduces inflammation, and activates cellular cleanup and repair processes.\n- Concentration camp survivors who experienced deep starvation often lived to be 90 or 100 years old.\n- Animal studies show that starvation and fasting can extend lifespan by a third.\n- It is not necessary to eat a third less calories to live a third longer, but timing of eating is important.\n- Give yourself 3 hours before bed for no food and at least 12 to 14 hours between dinner and breakfast.\n## Restricting Your Calories vs Fasting. [(00:44:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=2676s)\n- Calorie restriction alone may not provide the same longevity benefits as fasting.\n- Fasting can mimic starvation and induce autophagy, a process of self-cleaning and repair within cells.\n- Certain supplements and medications, such as rapamycin and metformin, are being studied for their potential to activate longevity pathways and mimic the effects of starvation.\n- Starvation can be beneficial but should be approached with caution to avoid extreme measures and disordered eating.\n- Finding a balance between activating and inhibiting [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) (mammalian target of rapamycin) is crucial for maintaining muscle mass and overall health.\n## What Are Blue Zones, and the Importance of Studying Them?

[(01:34:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbzn5iz8Mbo&t=5657s)\n- Function is a company that provides individuals with access to their own health data and personalized health insights through various tests, including blood tests, biosensor data, genomics, medical records, imaging data, metabolome, and microbiome analysis.\n- Function's testing often reveals undetected health issues such as lipoprotein fractionation problems, inflammation, autoimmune thyroid disease, nutritional deficiencies, and cancer.\n- Function uses AI to analyze data and provide personalized health insights and recommendations, empowering individuals to take control of their health and share their data with their doctors.\n- Dr. [Mark Hyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hyman_(doctor)) recommends his books \"Young Forever\" for optimizing health and longevity, and \"Food Fix\" for those confused about nutrition.\n- Dr. Hyman cites nutritional biochemist Jeffrey Bland as a major influence who saved his life and helped millions of people through functional medicine.\n- Dr. Hyman's childhood was profoundly impacted by [Henry David Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau)'s book \"Walden,\" which combined nature, life, philosophy, and Eastern philosophy.\n- Dr. Hyman manages stress by prioritizing health and well-being, emphasizing exercise, and using the Whoop device to monitor stress levels.\n- The Whoop app offers scientifically backed breathing exercises developed by leading neuroscientists and provides a 30-day risk-free trial.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=0s)\n- Dr. Tommy Wood acknowledges the widespread use of the term \"longevity\" and the conflicting information surrounding it, particularly regarding metabolic health and the role of insulin and protein.\n- He recognizes the abundance of conflicting advice online, making it difficult to discern accurate information.\n- Dr. Wood emphasizes his expertise in this field and expresses his desire to provide a clear and insightful perspective on the most impactful metabolic lever for longevity.\n\n## Free Sample Flavors Pack of LMNT [(00:00:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=38s)\n- Dr. Tommy Wood recommends a variety pack of LMNT electrolytes, which includes flavors like Citrus Salt, Lemon Habanero, Mango Chili, Chocolate Salt, and Unflavored.\n- He suggests that consuming electrolytes can help mitigate the increased food cravings associated with sleep deprivation, as research indicates that the brain becomes more sensitive to food cues in this state.\n- Dr. Wood acknowledges that LMNT is a sponsor of his channel and encourages viewers to try their products, as their support helps him continue creating content.\n\n## Metabolic Health for Longevity [(00:01:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=85s)\n- Metabolic health is crucial for longevity and overall health. This is likely due to the importance of mitochondrial function and its impact on various tissues. However, focusing solely on one aspect, like demonizing a specific macronutrient or hormone, can be misleading.\n- Energy surplus and toxicity are major contributors to negative effects on metabolic health. While growth and repair require insulin and protein, excessive energy intake can lead to detrimental consequences.\n- Metabolic health is more important for overweight individuals than lean individuals. Lean individuals have a better metabolic buffer, allowing them more flexibility in their diet and lifestyle. Overweight individuals, on the other hand, need to constantly create a \"sink\" for glucose and calories to manage their metabolic state. This means they need to be more mindful of their diet and exercise to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.\n\n## Do the Benefits of Exercise Decrease the More Trained You Become? [(00:06:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=408s)\n- The question of whether exercise benefits decrease with increased fitness is explored. The text discusses the release of metabolites like myokines and exokines during physical activity, which are believed to contribute to the health benefits of exercise. \n- The text acknowledges that the exact mechanisms by which exercise improves metabolic health are still being researched. While there are many newly discovered metabolites with potential benefits, the full picture of how they work is not yet understood.\n- The text suggests that the benefits of exercise, at least in terms of some metabolites like [BDNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor), may be proportional to the amount of muscle mass being moved, rather than being dependent on fitness level. This implies that even highly trained individuals can still experience significant benefits from exercise, although they may need to adjust the intensity or duration to achieve the same results.\n\n## How You Accrue Muscle Is Important [(00:11:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=664s)\n- Muscle mass alone may not be a good indicator of health benefits. Studies have shown that while increased muscle mass is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular death, increased grip strength is associated with lower risk. This suggests that muscle mass gained through caloric surplus, rather than exercise, may not provide the same health benefits.\n- Muscle strength relative to muscle mass is a better indicator of health benefits. Studies have shown that individuals with higher lean mass may have worse cognitive function, but this is only true if their muscle strength is not proportionate to their muscle size. This suggests that the way muscle is gained and used is more important than simply having more muscle.\n- Gaining muscle mass through caloric surplus may be detrimental to health. When individuals gain muscle mass through caloric surplus, they also tend to gain visceral fat, which has negative effects on cardiovascular health, cognitive health, and overall well-being. This suggests that focusing on gaining muscle through exercise and maintaining a healthy body fat percentage is crucial for overall health.\n\n## Ideal Body Fat % for Longevity [(00:16:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=982s)\n- It is difficult to determine the ideal body fat percentage for longevity because there is a lack of data on individuals with very low body fat percentages and high muscle mass. This is because such individuals are relatively rare and are not well-represented in large population datasets.\n- Based on average population data, the optimal body fat percentage for longevity appears to be between 15-20% for men and 20-30% for women. This is based on a fat-free mass index (FFMI) of around 19-20 for men and 17-19 for women.\n- While these figures are based on average population data, they may not apply to individuals with more athletic body compositions. There is a need for more research on the relationship between body composition and longevity in highly athletic populations.\n\n## Steroids & Longevity [(00:21:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=1270s)\n- Dr. Tommy Wood discusses a video he watched about the potential longevity of steroid users in the 1970s. The video suggested that these individuals, despite using steroids, had a longer lifespan than the average person.\n- Dr. Wood acknowledges that the video's claim is difficult to support due to a lack of data and the presence of confounding factors. He points out that it's challenging to compare athletes to athletes, especially when considering the health of the general population during that era.\n- Dr. Wood highlights that the health of the general population, particularly in [Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe), could have influenced the longevity of athletes. He suggests that athletes may have had access to better nutrition and healthcare, which could have contributed to their longer lifespans. He also notes that the quality of steroids available in the 1970s may have been different from what is available today.\n\n## Effect of Insulin on Longevity [(00:23:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=1391s)\n- Insulin is not inherently bad for longevity. While it is often associated with growth and [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) signaling, which can be detrimental in excess, insulin plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle and bone tissue, both of which are essential for healthy aging. \n- Insulin's primary function is to regulate energy partitioning. It acts as an anti-catabolic hormone, preventing the breakdown of fat and muscle tissue. This is essential for maintaining energy levels and preventing the depletion of vital resources. \n- High insulin levels are often a symptom of energy toxicity, not the cause. When we consume more energy than we need, insulin levels rise to prevent further breakdown of tissues. This is a sign that we are exceeding our personal fat threshold and accumulating visceral fat, which has negative health consequences.\n\n## Insulin & Muscle Hypertrophy [(00:29:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=1786s)\n- Insulin's role in muscle hypertrophy is complex and not fully understood. While insulin has anti-catabolic effects and can help fuel high-intensity activity, recent research suggests it may not directly contribute to ribosomal biogenesis and muscle protein synthesis. \n- Adequate calories and protein are crucial for muscle growth. Insulin primarily acts as a \"plug\" to prevent muscle breakdown, while the anabolic process is driven by the availability of amino acids. \n- High doses of exogenous insulin may potentially enhance muscle protein synthesis in bodybuilders. However, this is hypothetical and not supported by evidence within normal physiological insulin levels. \n- Post-workout carbohydrates may reduce cortisol levels, potentially aiding recovery. However, the study mentioned suggests that glycogen stores, not carbohydrates themselves, are the primary factor influencing muscle growth. \n- The impact of post-workout carbohydrates on recovery is debatable. While they may reduce cortisol, the effect on muscle growth may be minimal compared to the overall calorie intake.\n\n## Carbs for Longevity [(00:37:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ho7iAQgVbY&t=2242s)\n- Dr. Wood acknowledges that some long-lived populations consume relatively high amounts of carbohydrates, but he doesn't believe there's strong evidence to suggest that high carbohydrate intake directly promotes longevity. He points out that many long-lived populations also consume low amounts of carbohydrates, and their dietary patterns are often influenced by the availability of food in their environment.\n- Dr. Wood emphasizes that the exact distribution of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) may be less important than previously thought. He believes that individuals should focus on eating a diet that supports their lifestyle, physical activity, and overall well-being.\n- Dr. Wood suggests that adequate protein and insulin signaling are important for health, but he doesn't believe that insulin itself is directly pro-longevity. He believes that insulin's role in supporting physical activity and muscle mass is more significant. He also acknowledges that individual responses to different diets can vary greatly, and what works for one person may not work for another.\n\n## Where to Find More of Dr. Wood's Content

[(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=0s)\n- Lifespan Podcast focuses on the science of aging with [Dr. David Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Sinclair) discussing how to slow or reverse aging.\n- Joined by co-presenter Matthew LaPlante, episode six touches on cosmetic aging, distinguishing between purely aesthetic treatments and those impacting biological aging.\n- Aesthetic improvements are valued for social and emotional benefits, but emphasis is on technologies that fight aging at a biological level, including adversity and abundance mimetics.\n- Discussion includes methods for maintaining youthful appearance of hair, skin, and nails, and potentially reversing aging aspects.\n\n## Estrogen, Progesterone, and Menopause [(00:02:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=174s)\n- Conversation shifts to women's health, particularly menopause and its early onset impact on aging, neglecting it in a previous episode.\n- [Hormone Replacement Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy) (HRT) can assist women through menopause by maintaining proper hormone levels to protect against aging.\n- Concerns about menopause's harsh symptoms include mood swings, migraines, hot flashes, and increased risk of heart disease.\n- Advice on monitoring hormone levels to customize HRT and tracking health indicators like [Sex Hormone Binding Globulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin) (SHBG) to increase therapy effectiveness.\n- Correct ratios and timing of estrogen and progesterone are crucial; prolonged [HRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy) can prevent issues like heart disease and bone loss, though risks exist for breast cancer patients.\n- Menopause also causes epidermal thinning, which ties into the theme of cosmetic aging and overall skin health.\n\n## The Pinch Test, Epidermal Thinning, and Foot Ulcers [(00:12:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=777s)\n- Skin is the largest organ, 1/6 of body weight, and vital for overall health.\n- The skin pinch test is a quick assessment of skin's aging; younger skin snaps back quickly, while older skin takes longer.\n- Skin thins with age, leading to increased risks like bruising, tearing, and poor wound healing.\n- Epidermal thinning is particularly problematic post-menopause and in the elderly.\n- 13% of the US population suffers from foot ulcers, which are severe in elderly due to non-healing wounds.\n- Ulcers can worsen with conditions like diabetes leading to amputations and increased mortality.\n\n## Skin and Biological Aging [(00:18:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=1109s)\n- Aging skin is more than an aesthetic issue; it is related to overall health and lifespan.\n- A study showed older-looking individuals were more likely to die within seven years than younger-looking people of the same age.\n- Families with centenarians often look younger than their chronological age, suggesting a correlation between looks and biological age.\n- While initial studies showed no correlation between biological clocks and perceived age, later studies using skin-specific clocks found a better correspondence.\n- Skin can age faster than other tissues due to environmental exposure, such as UV light which can cause DNA damage and accelerate aging.\n- Australians have high skin cancer rates due to UV exposure, prompting public health measures like complimentary sunscreen at beaches.\n- Damaging effects of the sun are now better understood, with suggestions that some damage to the skin may be reversible.\n\n## Cellular Senescence, Ultraviolet Light, and Skin Aging [(00:23:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=1399s) \n- Skin aging involves accumulation of senescent cells which stop dividing and secrete harmful inflammatory factors.\n- [Senolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senolytic) drugs, like ABT-263 ([Navitoclax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navitoclax)) and rapamycin, can kill senescent cells and rejuvenate skin.\n- A study demonstrated that treating skin biopsies with senolytics thickened the skin and reversed its biological age, as measured by a specialized skin DNA methylation clock.\n- Senescent cells contribute to overall aging, with most senescent cells in the skin due to UV damage.\n- Protecting skin from UV light, using sunscreen, and potentially employing senolytics can decrease the load of senescent cells.\n- UV light causes DNA damage by fusing adjacent thymine bases in DNA, impeding DNA replication and cell function.\n- Repairing DNA damage from UV exposure disrupts cellular protein organization, leading to cell identity loss.\n\n## Collagen, Keratin, and Skin Health [(00:28:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=1695s)\n- Currently, senolytic drugs like rapamycin and ABT-263 are not available for topical use on skin.\n- Peptides from a skin study were found to have anti-aging effects when applied topically, with one peptide showing promise in a product called OneSkin.\n- [Collagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen) production decreases with age and is a target for many beauty products to enhance skin health.\n- The effectiveness of ingesting collagen supplements and their ability to reach the bloodstream intact is uncertain, but they are considered safe.\n- Retinoids are proven to boost collagen production, reduce wrinkles, and promote the growth of skin layers and fibroblasts while reducing pigmentation.\n- Use of retinoids must be balanced to avoid dryness and sensitivity to sunlight.\n- Retinoids activate certain genes for cell growth and inhibit enzymes that degrade skin proteins.\n- Keratinocytes, which produce keratin, another key protein for skin, hair, and nails, can be stimulated by retinoids.\n\n## A Quick Aside about Nails [(00:33:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=2018s) \n- Nail growth rate is an indicator of biological aging, decreasing about half a percent per year.\n- Historical data, such as a long-term study by an individual named Mr. Bean, support that nail growth rates correlate with the aging process.\n\n## Autophagy and Retinoids [(00:34:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=2085s)\n- Biting nails can be jestingly associated with autophagy, a process beneficial to lifespan.\n- [Autophagy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy) involves recycling old proteins in the cell, and can be influenced by retinoic acids.\n- Different levels of autophagy occur, from shallow (skipping meals) to deeper cleansing (extended fasting).\n- A protein called [LAMP2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP2), controlled by retinoic acids, regulates deeper chaperone-mediated autophagy.\n- Enhancing chaperone-mediated autophagy in mice significantly increased their lifespan.\n- Retinoids, despite having benefits, might negatively impact long-term skin health by inhibiting this autophagy mechanism.\n- It's suggested to use retinols intermittently, possibly avoiding use when fasting.\n\n## Resveratrol, NAD Boosters, and Hyaluronic Acid [(00:36:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=2217s)\n- Literature suggests that most antioxidants do not have a significant impact on longevity.\n- [Resveratrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol), while an antioxidant, likely benefits the skin by activating body defenses and sirtuin activity, not through its antioxidant properties.\n- Topical creams with resveratrol and NAD-boosting molecules, like nicotinamide, are beneficial for skin health.\n- Ongoing research is focused on boosting NAD directly in the skin.\n- [Hyaluronic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronic_acid) (HA) is acclaimed for its skin and body-wide benefits, including cancer resistance in studies with animals like naked mole rats.\n- Injectable HA can be effective for skin volume loss and laxity.\n- Smaller [HA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronic_acid) oligomers in creams may penetrate the skin better, and resveratrol can enhance HA synthesis.\n\n## Botox, Skin Peels, and Microneedling [(00:41:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=2504s)\n- [Botox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin) is a popular cosmetic treatment for wrinkles that works by inhibiting neurotransmission to muscles.\n- The effects of Botox are cosmetic, with no known anti-aging implications at the cellular level beyond appearance.\n- Skin peels mainly provide a superficial benefit, rather than anti-aging effects.\n- Microneedling might trigger hormetic effects that potentially benefit skin aging, though confirmation is needed.\n\n## No Duh Stuff: Sun Damage, Smoking, Alcohol, and Bad Food [(00:43:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=2608s)\n- Avoiding sun damage, smoking, and the consumption of alcohol is critical for maintaining skin health.\n- Alcohol consumption was recently associated with negative skin effects.\n- Poor diet, especially one high in processed foods, fats, and chemicals, accelerates aging visibly in skin and hair.\n\n## Hair Loss and Hair Graying [(00:45:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=2742s)\n- Hair loss has over 600 genes involved, with only about 20 on the X chromosome, accounting for roughly 11% of male pattern baldness.\n- For females, hair loss genetics are split 50/50 between both parents since the X chromosome is involved.\n- Hair loss is strongly genetically determined, and while it can be slowed, it's not a major health concern and in some professions, long hair can be hazardous.\n- Evolutionarily, hair loss and graying signified dominance and wisdom, as seen in the silverback gorilla's societal structure.\n- Hair loss at a cellular level involves malfunctioning hair follicle stem cells getting expelled and follicle shrinkage due to dihydrotestosterone, leading to thinner hair.\n\n## Topical Treatments, Pills, and Dihydrotestosterone [(00:49:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=2985s)\n- [Minoxidil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoxidil) (Rogaine), a treatment for hair loss, was initially a blood pressure medication and stimulates nitric oxide production, promoting hair growth.\n- [Tretinoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tretinoin) (Retin-A) also promotes hair regrowth, especially when combined with minoxidil.\n- The pill [Propecia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finasteride) (finasteride) inhibits dihydrotestosterone ([DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone)), which is linked to hair thinning; optimal DHT levels correlate with longevity.\n- Studies have shown eunuchs live significantly longer than average men, suggesting lower levels of testosterone might increase lifespan.\n- Propecia can reduce hair loss effectively, but it can also have side effects like mood swings, decreased sex drive, and breast tenderness, so monitoring and doctor guidance are essential.\n\n## Frickin Laser Beams: Low-level Laser Therapy [(00:55:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=3319s)\n- [Low-level laser therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_laser_therapy) (LLLT) using red laser light is FDA-approved for hair regrowth and has few side effects.\n- LLLT is delivered through devices like combs or caps, usually for 10-15 minute sessions.\n- Clinical trials have shown it can slow hair loss and regrow hair in many individuals.\n- The mechanism is unclear, but may involve nitric oxide's effect on mitochondria.\n- Laser light disrupts enzyme interaction with the electron transport chain in mitochondria.\n- This disruption may lead to mitohormesis, enhancing stem cell energy and potentially rejuvenation.\n- Red laser light, capable of penetrating skin layers, might have broader beneficial body effects and is used in infrared saunas.\n\n## Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) Injections [(00:57:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=3479s)\n- [PRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-rich_plasma) injections, using one's own centrifuged blood, are used for hair loss and other conditions.\n- PRP is rich in growth factors, exosomes, hormones, and peptides, which might rejuvenate hair follicle stem cells.\n- The specific active component in PRP is unknown.\n- There is potential anti-aging effects from [PRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platelet-rich_plasma), linking to systemic rejuvenation seen in animal studies.\n\n## Hair Aging, Stress, and Gray Hair Reversal [(01:00:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=3611s)\n- Growth of hair in unwanted places (like ears or nose) could be due to aging-related changes in DNA structure.\n- Delaying aging might prevent these changes and unwanted hair growth.\n- Psychological stress is known to accelerate graying; recent studies suggest gray hair can, under some conditions, revert to its original color.\n- Hair color changes are likely epigenetic, influenced by the functional state of melanocyte stem cells.\n- A combination treatment tested in mice suggests a potential for reversing graying, involving drugs like cyclosporine and rapamycin analogs, which also rejuvenate mitochondria and simulate a fasting response.\n- This treatment is not ready for human use, but hints at future possibilities for hair repigmentation through scientific advances.\n\n## Targeting Aging Upstream [(01:06:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=3971s)\n- Addressing aging pathways can impact various conditions that are downstream.\n- The lessons learned from reversing skin aging and improving hair color could be applied to other organs.\n- Cells share fundamental aging causes and defense pathways.\n- Drugs like rapamycin, cyclosporine, and minoxidil could be tested for whole-body rejuvenation effects.\n- Future treatments could potentially lead to taking pills to not only reverse aging but also regenerate and darken hair.\n\n## Today’s Takeaways [(01:07:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Laa2LiS2E&t=4057s)\n- The big picture is the potential to reverse aging internally and externally.\n- Future treatments may involve injectables, edibles, or topical products to deliver anti-aging molecules.\n- Initially considered superficial, anti-aging research is seen as a way to improve overall health.\n- Traditional health advice remains important: exercise, diet, sleep, and stress reduction.\n- Looking good through healthy practices can be a byproduct of a longer life span.","## Introducing Episode Three: Exercise Hot Cold [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=0s)\n- The Lifespan podcast is hosted by [Dr. David Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Sinclair), a genetics professor at Harvard, and Matthew LaPlante, his co-author and cohost.\n- The episode explores adversity mimetics, which are practices that can improve health and longevity.\n- They briefly touch upon the previous episode’s topic of [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron) and its relevance to aging.\n\n## A Pernicious Element Called Iron (Fe) [(00:01:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=61s) and A Quick Primer on Free Radicals [(00:02:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=166s)\n- Excess iron in the body is associated with accelerated aging.\n- Iron is essential for oxygen transport in hemoglobin, but high levels can be harmful.\n- Too much [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron), especially ferrous iron, leads to free radical production, damaging tissues and causing senescent cell accumulation.\n- Three main types of [free radicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(chemistry)) are superoxide molecules, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide.\n- High iron levels turn hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, damaging DNA, RNA, lipids, and proteins.\n- People with the [HFE gene mutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_haemochromatosis) are more susceptible to [iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron) overload.\n- Regular blood tests can help monitor iron levels, with blood donation being a potential remedy for those with [hemochromatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overload).\n\n## Review of Dietary Takeaways [(00:05:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=342s)\n- Dr. Sinclair recommends a plant-based diet and eating less frequently to turn on defensive genes against aging.\n- The three main defense mechanisms against aging are [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR), [AMPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase), and [sirtuins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin).\n- They argue for a diet and lifestyle that activates these protective genes through perceived adversity, such as fasting and exercising.\n\n## Biological Adversity and the Survival Circuit [(00:09:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=572s)\n- Adversity mimetics are practices that mimic biological adversity, known to enhance lifespan and health span.\n- The idea of a survival circuit was introduced, based on [Cynthia Kenyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Kenyon)'s 1990s research on longevity genes in worms.\n- Longevity genes like the DAF-2 [insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin) receptor and sirtuins were found to control the aging process.\n- These longevity genes activate survival and stress resistance pathways in response to environmental adversity.\n\n## Survival Sensors and Communicators [(00:13:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=804s)\n- mTOR, AMPK, and Sirtuins are cellular sensors that monitor environmental conditions such as amino acid levels, energy availability, and [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels, respectively.\n- Insulin acts as a cellular communicator that signals the presence of sugar in the body, telling cells to absorb and use it.\n- Adversity in human history activated these longevity defenses as a response to stress from being cold, hungry, or threatened by predators.\n- Modern comfort stifles these longevity defenses, leading to health issues.\n- Intermittent fasting with adequate nutrition (IFAN) can activate these defenses without negative consequences.\n- Bodies can be 'tricked' into a survival state, improving metabolism, alertness, and defense against diseases, despite the availability of food.\n\n## Get Off Your Butt and Exercise Protects against Disease and Mortality [(00:17:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=1045s) [(00:19:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=1180s)\n- Physical activity, such as standing, walking, or running, induces beneficial stress on the body.\n- Sitting leads to muscle atrophy, reduced hormone levels, and potential health issues.\n- Standing desks and other means of avoiding prolonged sitting can prevent these problems.\n- Regular exercise prevents diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease, with up to a 23% and 30% reduction in risk, respectively.\n- All-cause mortality and aging are reduced by 27% with regular exercise.\n- Biological aging clocks, like the Horvath clock, can measure the effect of exercise on slowing the aging process.\n\n## Daily Step Count and Walking After Eating [(00:21:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=1277s)\n- All exercise is beneficial; the 10,000 steps a day goal is a general guideline, with notable health benefits starting at 4,000-6,000 steps.\n- Walking after a meal can help regulate glucose levels and improve blood circulation.\n\n## Exercise Activates AMPK and Creates More Mitochondria [(00:22:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=1353s)\n- Exercise activates AMPK, which senses low energy levels in the cell and leads to the creation of more [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion), providing long-term health benefits beyond the exercise period.\n- Both low-level and vigorous exercises are important, with vigorous exercise defined by increased breathing and heart rates.\n\n## Vigorous Exercise, Hypoxia, and the Electron Transport Chain [(00:24:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=1443s)\n- Vigorous exercise induces hypoxia, which translates to low oxygen levels beneficial for health.\n- Hypoxia activates [HIF-1alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIF1A), triggering genes responsible for new blood vessel growth and enhancing mitochondria.\n- During vigorous exercise, lack of oxygen leads to free radical generation, specifically superoxide radicals.\n- Electrons in the mitochondria are normally used in the [electron transport chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transport_chain) to produce ATP.\n- Reduced oxygen levels cause these electrons to create free radicals, leading to cell damage - a process called mitohormesis.\n- Mitohormesis can stimulate the production of more [mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion) and improve energy levels over time.\n- Vigorous exercise increases mitochondria and blood vessel count, which diminish as we age, but there are ways to reverse this process through exercise and other interventions.\n\n## Exercise Increases Glucose Sensitivity and Stimulates Blood Vessel Formation [(00:28:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=1699s)\n- A small amount of stress, like exercise, improves bodily functions, such as increasing insulin sensitivity and blood vessel formation.\n- As people age, muscles and brains become less sensitive to [insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin) due to cellular identity loss and decreased GLUT4 transporter proteins.\n- Glucose inability to enter cells leads to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease from blood vessel lining damage.\n- Exercise stimulates the production of [VEGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor), promoting new blood vessel growth in response to muscular activity.\n- [PGC-1alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPARGC1A), a transcription factor, boosts VEGF production, which then causes [endothelial cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelium) to create new capillaries.\n- Aging impairs this VEGF response, even with exercise, but NAD production activated through exercise can restore muscle youthfulness and stimulate blood vessel growth.\n\n## The Epigenome and Biological Age are Impacted by Exercise [(00:32:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=1933s) \n- Exercise impacts the [epigenome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenome), which regulates gene activity.\n- A healthy lifestyle and exercise can make an individual's epigenetic age younger according to biological clocks like the Horvath clock or the proteomic clock.\n- [GDF15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDF15), a protein that changes over time, is a marker for biological age.\n- Studies indicate that aerobically active individuals are epigenetically younger by about five and a half years compared to sedentary people.\n- Biological age can predict mortality, but about 80% of future health is modifiable, suggesting lifestyle choices can significantly affect aging.\n\n## How to Measure your Biological Age [(00:36:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=2203s) \n- Biological age can be measured through blood tests or DNA tests, with services offered by companies like InsideTracker.\n- A methodology developed at Dr. Sinclair's lab could reduce the cost of biological age testing to under a dollar.\n\n## Exercise Recommendations [(00:37:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=2251s) \n- Exercise does not have to be running; any physical activity that increases heart rate and breathing is beneficial.\n- The [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) and [Mayo Clinic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic) recommend at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise weekly.\n- Even with a busy or unhealthy lifestyle, 10 minutes a day of elevated heart rate exercise is achievable.\n\n## Wearables and Individualized Health Tracking [(00:39:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=2368s) \n- Monitoring fitness parameters like resting heart rate can be done through wearables like fitness rings or watches.\n- Modern bio monitors can track numerous health metrics many times a second, potentially predicting medical conditions.\n- Long-term health tracking enables individuals to optimize their health and provide valuable data during medical consultations.\n- Advances in wearable technology are integrating more with exercise and health management.\n\n\n\n## The Importance of Weight Training [(00:43:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=2594s)\n- Weight training is an enjoyable form of exercise that is beneficial for maintaining hormone levels, posture, muscle mass, and bone strength.\n- Engaging in weight training regularly helps counteract the natural loss of muscle mass that occurs with aging, approximately 1% per year.\n- Adequate muscle mass and flexibility, especially around the waist, reduce the likelihood of breaking bones during falls, which can be as severe as having metastatic cancer in terms of mortality rates.\n- Building and maintaining muscle through weight training can naturally boost testosterone levels more effectively than topical applications or injections.\n\n## Physical Activity and Senescent Cells [(00:46:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=2768s)\n- [Senescent cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence), or \"zombie cells,\" secrete harmful chemicals and contribute to aging and disease.\n- A study indicated that a 12-week exercise program can decrease the number of senescent cells.\n- Exercise, lifestyle choices, certain supplements, and drugs can either slow the formation or eliminate senescent cells from the body.\n\n## Exercise Wrap-up and Takeaways [(00:48:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=2881s)\n- Low-level exercise such as walking, even below the often suggested 10,000 steps, is beneficial.\n- High-intensity exercise a few times a week is important for vascular health and mitochondrial function.\n- Muscle-building exercises are essential for maintaining hormone levels and overall health. They're simple to do and can be performed at home without a gym.\n- The overarching goal of exercise is to trigger longevity genes through adversity mimetics, which promote longevity.\n\n## Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) [(00:49:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=2987s) \n- [Hyperbaric oxygen therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) (HBOT) is acknowledged as an adversity mimetic akin to exercise, impacting cellular and genetic levels.\n- Wound healing benefits from increased oxygen, with theories suggesting hormesis or better tissue growth from enhanced oxygen supply.\n- HBOT involves a pressurized environment which boosts oxygen intake; it's used by the military and is becoming popular for treating neurological disorders and aging.\n- A study in Israel showed [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine) could reverse telomere shortening, potentially slowing aging and extending life, with impressive results in mice and humans.\n- Data indicated HBOT reduced Alzheimer's plaques and tangles in mice and improved dementia and Parkinson's in humans.\n- Human studies suggested increases in cognitive performance, telomere length, T helper cells, and reductions in senescent cells.\n- The theory behind HBOT's effectiveness posits it may work similarly to the benefits derived from hypoxia during exercise, involving HIF-1alpha protein and a mitohormesis response.\n- The Israeli study protocol included 60 sessions lasting 90 minutes each, showing reversals in aging markers and a decrease in senescent immune cells.\n- [HBOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)'s accessibility is improving as it becomes more popular, with the potential to mimic exercise benefits for those unable to perform physical activity.\n\n## Conclusion\n- HBOT is an emerging and promising therapy for longevity and health, offering benefits similar to physical exercise and the potential for cognitive improvements and anti-aging effects. The treatment is scalable, and research is ongoing to fully understand its mechanisms and applications.\n\n## Cold Therapy [(00:57:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=3444s)\n- [Cold therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy) is a form of stress that triggers the production of [brown or beige fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue), beneficial for metabolic health.\n- Brown fat, also found in adults, burns white fat and secretes health-promoting proteins.\n- The gene [PRDM16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRDM16) is crucial for converting white fat to brown; its absence leads to health problems like diabetes and cardiovascular disease in mice.\n- Being cold has been shown to have longevity benefits in various organisms, including an increased lifespan observed in cold-stressed dwarf mice, albeit due to an unintended cold environment.\n- [Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncoupling_protein) (UCPs) in brown fat can reduce free radical production and have been associated with longer lifespans in different species.\n- Cold therapy, also known as cryotherapy, induces shivering and stimulates brown fat production, which may have lasting health benefits.\n- Establishing cold-resistant [brown fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue) reserves at a younger age is recommended, as older mice are less efficient at producing it.\n\n## Applying Heat [(01:03:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=3830s)\n- Heat stress, like sauna use, prompts the body to activate heat shock proteins ([HSPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock_protein)), aiding in protein folding and stimulating pathways for new blood vessels and more mitochondria.\n- Regular sauna sessions are associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular disease and related mortality, but optimal sauna usage guidelines are not well-established.\n- Both extreme heat and cold treatments are seen as ways to shock the body for potential health benefits, termed adversity mimetics.\n- No conclusive evidence shows that excessive sauna use is harmful, but medical consultation is recommended.\n- Alternatives like hot showers can simulate the effects of sauna for those without access to one.\n- Infrared saunas are believed to penetrate the skin and may reverse aspects of skin aging and improve hair growth.\n\n## Adversity Mimetics Produce Endorphins [(01:07:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=4024s)\n- [Endorphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins) are released when engaging in vigorous exercise, [cryotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryotherapy), or heat therapy, providing a sense of well-being.\n- A physical indication that beneficial longevity protocols are working is the release of endorphins at the neurological level, concurrent with the activation of cellular defense pathways.\n- The pleasurable effects from endorphin release after these stress-inducing activities suggest that the body is responding positively to the induced adversity.\n\n## A Basic Protocol for Mimicking Adversity [(01:08:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=4087s)\n- Individuals can vary in their response to protocols for exercise, cold, heat, and hyperbaric exposure.\n- A recommended routine involves cycling through heat and cold exposure about five times in one day of the week, potentially even daily.\n- Exercise is essential and previously discussed.\n- Cold exposure can be achieved with cold showers or baths at home if gym access is limited.\n- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is likened to exercise and hypoxia at the molecular level but is less accessible due to cost and availability.\n- Safety is important, and extreme exercises like underwater weight training are not recommended for the general public.\n\n## Next Week’s Episode: Molecules and Supplements [(01:10:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc5EXX9YWg&t=4204s)\n- Future discussions will cover exciting developments in longevity, including the use of molecules and supplements to mimic the benefits of physical and environmental stressors.\n- The next episode will delve into how pills and injections can simulate the stress of exercise and other adversities that contribute to longevity.\n- There is anticipation that this topic will garner high interest and possibly be one of the most downloaded episodes.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=0s)\n- We age primarily by damaging core systems like the circulatory system, and glucose plays a significant role in this process, with high blood sugar being linked to insulin resistance and the accumulation of [senescent cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_senescence) [(00:00:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=11s).\n- [Senescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence) cells are defined as cells that have aged normally, reached the end of their lifespan, and stopped dividing, switching to a phenotype that produces pro-inflammatory and potentially cancer-causing signaling molecules [(00:00:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=44s).\n- These cells must be cleared to allow for normal repair and replacement, as they secrete toxic chemicals that disrupt tissue and organ function, contributing to unhealthy aging and inflammation [(00:01:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=91s).\n- Senescent cells, also known as \"zombie cells,\" play a positive role in younger individuals, particularly in tissue remodeling and renovation, such as the separation of fingers in a developing fetus [(00:02:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=153s).\n- The process of senescent cells helping with tissue remodeling can be compared to the use of scaffolding in construction, where the scaffold is necessary for building a structure but is eventually torn down once the main structure is complete [(00:03:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=203s).\n- Dr. Bob Hariri's description of glucose as a \"broken shard of glass\" in the circulation highlights the dangers of high blood sugar and its impact on the body [(00:00:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=16s).\n- The connection between insulin resistance, high blood sugar, and [senescent cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_senescence) is a significant area of study in the field of longevity [(00:00:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=22s).\n- [Senescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence) cells are not all the same age or functional level, and they play a role in the continuum of cell development and tissue remodeling throughout an individual's life [(00:02:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=156s).\n\n## 30% Off Your First Order AND a Free Gift Worth up to $60

[(00:04:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=295s).\n\n## Senescent Cells [(00:04:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=298s)\n- [Senescent cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_senescence) can be thought of as a clone of oneself that initially helps with tasks, but eventually becomes problematic and deleterious to one's life when they become dysfunctional, similar to a clone that starts causing trouble by having an affair with one's spouse [(00:04:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=298s).\n- [Senescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence) cells are helpful to a certain degree, but when they get out of hand or become more dysfunctional with age, they become problematic and need to be cleared [(00:05:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=340s).\n- The elimination of senescent cells can be likened to demolition work that needs to be done to renovate a house, making room for new, healthy, and young cells to replace the broken structures [(00:06:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=366s).\n- Targeting and getting rid of senescent cells allows for renewal and renovation with healthy cells, making room for new growth [(00:06:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=378s).\n\n## Glucose Control for Longevity [(00:06:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=392s)\n- [Senescent cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_senescence) are cleared from the body through the activity of natural killer cells, a specialized form of white blood cell that is part of the innate immune system, which attacks and destroys cells that exhibit abnormal behavior due to infection, cancer, or other reasons, indicated by the expression of stress antigens on their surface [(00:06:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=417s).\n- Natural killer cells track and surgically remove cells with these stress antigens, and maximizing natural killer cell function is crucial for maintaining health and longevity [(00:07:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=462s).\n- One way to maximize natural killer cell function is to keep glucose levels low, as high glucose levels can inactivate natural killer cells, which is associated with damage to the immune system and increased risk of infections and diseases [(00:08:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=487s).\n- Keeping hemoglobin A1c levels low, which is a marker of glucose control, is critically important for maintaining high-performance immune function and preserving natural killer cell function [(00:08:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=510s).\n- New drugs like GLP1 agonists can help achieve better glucose control, which can have benefits for health and longevity by maintaining high-performance immune function and preserving natural killer cell function [(00:08:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=519s).\n- GLP1 receptor agonists have been around for a while and can play an interesting role in controlling glucose levels, and other tools like metformin have also been associated with benefits in lifespan and health by improving insulin sensitivity and keeping circulating glucose levels low [(00:09:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=566s).\n- Metformin has been shown to have benefits in lifespan and health by improving insulin sensitivity and keeping circulating glucose levels below a threshold that glycosites proteins, protecting against the negative consequences of diabetes [(00:09:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=571s).\n- Even athletes who require high glucose levels for optimal performance may need to balance this with the negative consequences of high glucose levels on health and longevity, as seen in extreme examples like [Tour de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_de_France) athletes who keep their blood sugar levels high during rides for extra performance [(00:10:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=611s).\n- High blood glucose levels may not negatively impact longevity in individuals with a normal pancreas, as the body tends to store excess glucose rather than keeping it in circulation, especially in highly physically active states [(00:10:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=639s).\n- Even with high glucose utilization, it's challenging to maintain high blood glucose levels due to the release of endogenous insulin, which promotes glucose storage [(00:10:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=643s).\n- Measuring glucose levels using peripheral monitors may not accurately reflect long-term consequences, and glucose levels may return to normal quickly in highly physically active individuals [(00:11:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=668s).\n- Peripheral insulin resistance can occur during intermittent fasting or a ketogenic diet, leading to temporary increases in glucose levels, but this is not pathological and may not affect overall insulin resistance or HbA1c levels [(00:11:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=694s).\n- Insulin itself, independent of glucose levels, may not play a significant role in NK cell function, as the data suggests that only free glucose levels above a certain threshold can decrease NK cell activity and inhibit their function [(00:12:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=732s).\n- NK cells are affected by the surrounding glucose environment, and high free glucose levels can profoundly inhibit their function, even if insulin levels are not elevated [(00:12:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=747s).\n\n## Optimal HbA1c Level [(00:12:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=756s)\n- [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin) markers in the blood are snapshots and do not necessarily reflect long-term exposure to free glucose that an NK cell has experienced [(00:12:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=758s).\n- Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the best long-term measure of glucose control, and people with high HbA1c levels have decreased NK function, which has negative consequences [(00:12:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=772s).\n- The lower the HbA1c level, the better, and even within the healthy range, there is a difference in NK function, with lower levels being beneficial [(00:13:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=793s).\n- A HbA1c level of 5.7 is considered a threshold, and it is argued that the lower the level, the better, with benefits not just for NK cells but also for a general reduction in exposure to free glucose [(00:13:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=811s).\n- Lower HbA1c levels are associated with improved liver and renal functionality, and it is suggested that keeping glucose burden down, as reflected in a lower HbA1c, is beneficial [(00:13:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=830s).\n- HbA1c is a measure of glucose control over a long period and does not account for peaks and valleys in glucose levels that occur during the day [(00:14:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=854s).\n- Blood tests, including HbA1c, are snapshots and can be influenced by various factors, such as time of day, diet, and activity level, making it essential to consider multiple factors when interpreting results [(00:14:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=893s).\n\n## Glucose Monitors [(00:15:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=924s)\n- Wearable glucose sensors can download enormous amounts of data, which is crucial in medicine as it allows for better trend analysis and management of health variables [(00:15:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=925s).\n- The amount of data generated is important, but managing the trends in that data is more crucial, as seen in aviation where managing trends in turbine pressure is key [(00:15:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=940s).\n- Wearable sensor systems that can monitor 50 or 100 different variables continually and upload them to the cloud for analysis by AI and machine learning are expected to become available in the future [(00:16:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=967s).\n- This technology will enable predictive analysis and allow individuals and AI systems to identify potential health issues before they arise [(00:16:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=990s).\n- A single blood test result can be misleading and may cause unnecessary panic, as it only provides a snapshot of a person's health at a particular point in time [(00:16:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=997s).\n- Repeating a blood test can often provide a different result, and following the trajectory of a change in a value is essential for making accurate diagnostic judgments [(00:17:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1040s).\n- Failing to follow the trajectory of a change in a value can be a disservice to making diagnostic judgments, and it is essential to consider trends in data rather than relying on a single result [(00:17:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1057s).\n\n## The Danger of (high) Glucose [(00:17:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1067s)\n- Keeping glucose levels lower and stable improves longevity by reducing damage to core systems like the circulatory system [(00:17:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1070s).\n- Glucose damages the lining of blood vessels, stimulating an inflammatory response that can lead to scarring and degenerative vascular disease [(00:18:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1094s).\n- Atherosclerosis is considered a degenerative vascular disease, characterized by scarring of the blood vessel wall, rather than just a metabolic or lipid management problem [(00:19:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1140s).\n- Degenerative vascular disease has two pathways: regeneration, where things get fixed to normal, or scarring, which is a hallmark of aging [(00:19:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1153s).\n- Maintaining health as one ages requires stopping anything that creates an inflammatory cascade leading to scarring in blood vessels [(00:19:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1175s).\n- Type 2 diabetes is a higher risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and there is an interplay between the two conditions [(00:19:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1191s).\n- Changes in blood glucose can rapidly affect the ability to fight infection, and high blood sugar can impair immune system function [(00:20:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1214s).\n- In post-operative patients with type 2 diabetes, high blood sugar can lead to abnormal immune system function, making it harder to fight infections [(00:20:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1222s).\n- Controlling blood glucose is crucial in situations like surgical wounds, and can be achieved through insulin, glucose management tools, or other methods [(00:21:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1278s).\n- Keeping glucose under control maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the immune system [(00:21:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1316s).\n\n## Should Non-Diabetics Use CGMs? [(00:22:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1322s)\n- There is a common perception that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are not beneficial for non-diabetic individuals, and may even be harmful if it leads to obsessive eating patterns, but this perspective may be based on a misunderstanding of how to use the data from [CGMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor) [(00:22:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1323s).\n- A more practical approach to using CGMs is to view the data as a tool for understanding overall trends and patterns, rather than obsessing over individual readings, and to use data analysis tools to gain insights from the data [(00:22:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1346s).\n- The use of CGMs can be compared to blood pressure monitoring, where regular monitoring can provide valuable insights into overall health, and can help to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent from occasional readings [(00:22:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1371s).\n- Mark Twain's quote about \"lies, damn lies, and statistics\" highlights the importance of using data analysis tools to interpret the data from CGMs, rather than simply looking at individual readings [(00:23:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1391s).\n- The data from CGMs can be skewed if it is only collected in a clinical setting, such as a doctor's office or lab, as this may not be representative of an individual's typical daily patterns [(00:23:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1430s).\n- Continuous monitoring of glucose levels can provide a more accurate picture of an individual's physiology, and can help to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent from occasional readings [(00:24:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1447s).\n- The use of [CGMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor) is likely to become more widespread and accepted in the future, and may eventually be seen as a standard tool for monitoring health, much like blood pressure monitoring is today [(00:24:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1459s).\n\n## Adopting Aviation Tools [(00:24:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1483s)\n- The adoption of tools from the aviation industry in medicine is necessary to improve healthcare, with the aviation industry having decades of experience in root cause analysis to address problems. [(00:24:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1483s)\n- In advanced aircraft, there are two systems that benefit from this analysis: the master caution button, which indicates an impending problem that needs to be addressed, and the master warning button, which signals a critical issue that requires immediate action. [(00:24:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1494s)\n- Medicine needs a similar system to coalesce and interpret various health data, such as blood glucose, immune cell function, blood pressure, and blood viscosity, to identify potential problems before they become critical. [(00:25:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1530s)\n- A deep analytic tool that can assemble and analyze this information would enable the creation of a strategy to correct problems and prevent them from progressing to irreversible issues. [(00:25:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1548s)\n- The use of AI and machine learning can help absorb and analyze this data in a comprehensive way, and it is expected that the ability to digest this information will improve significantly in the next 5 to 10 years, similar to the advancements in aviation. [(00:26:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1578s)\n\n## Where to Find More of Dr. Hariri [(00:26:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1601s)\n- Dr. Bob Hariri's podcast can be found at pilotinghealth.com, a name that reflects his connection to aviation [(00:26:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1601s).\n- Dr. Bob Hariri can be found on social media under the handle @DrBobHariri [(00:26:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1610s).\n- Dr. Bob Hariri's company can be followed at cellularity.com and Fountain Life can be found at fountainlife.com [(00:26:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJO5MDf5q80&t=1613s).","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=0s)\n- This chapter introduces Dr. Vonda Wright, a renowned orthopedic surgeon and researcher specializing in mobility and aging. She emphasizes the importance of maintaining strength throughout life, highlighting the significant muscle loss that occurs with inactivity.\n- Dr. Wright uses MRI images to illustrate the difference between a 40-year-old athlete and a 74-year-old who has prioritized mobility. The images demonstrate the dramatic impact of consistent movement on muscle health.\n- The chapter also addresses the issue of joint pain, emphasizing that it is not inevitable. Dr. Wright explains that even small weight gains can significantly increase pressure on joints, highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy weight for joint health.\n\n## I Want Everyone To Have A Healthy Ageing Process [(00:02:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=138s)\n- Dr. Vonda Wright is passionate about changing the way we age. She believes that aging does not have to be an inevitable decline into frailty, but rather a process of continued vitality and activity. \n- Her belief stems from her childhood experiences witnessing active older adults and her time as a cancer nurse, where she saw people fighting for their lives and defying the notion of a predetermined decline.\n- Dr. Wright's research and work have challenged the traditional view of aging, which was based on population studies that primarily reflected the effects of sedentary living. She and her team have proven that active individuals can maintain health, vitality, and joy well into their later years.\n\n## Your Ageing Mindset Is The Cause Of Your Health Decline [(00:05:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=350s)\n- Dr. Vonda Wright discusses the \"mind virus\" of accepting decline as inevitable with age. She argues that this belief can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy, causing individuals to give up on their health and become frail.\n- She highlights the difference between life expectancy and health expectancy, noting that while people in the UK and US are expected to live to 81 and 77.6 years respectively, their healthy lifespan is only around 63 years. This suggests a significant window of opportunity to improve health and longevity.\n- Dr. Wright emphasizes that lifestyle choices play a crucial role in health and aging, accounting for 70-90% of the factors involved. This empowers individuals to take control of their health and live beyond their genetic predispositions, challenging the \"mind virus\" of inevitable decline.\n\n## This Is When You’ll Start Having Life-Threatening Diseases [(00:08:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=485s)\n- The average age for developing life-threatening diseases is 62.9 years old. This age corresponds to the average retirement age, meaning many people may face health issues just as they are starting to enjoy their free time.\n- These diseases include heart disease, lung cancer, [COPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease), strokes, lower respiratory infections, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, colon rectal cancers, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. While these diseases may manifest later in life, they can develop earlier and go unnoticed due to a lack of medical attention or mild symptoms.\n- The period between 40 and 63 years old is crucial for course correction in health. This is the time to prioritize health and make lifestyle changes to prevent or manage potential health issues. Waiting until 63 to address health concerns makes it significantly harder to make a positive impact.\n\n## What's Your Academic Background [(00:10:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=650s)\n- Dr. Vonda Wright holds a Bachelor's degree in Biology from [Wheaton College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheaton_College_(Illinois)).\n- She then pursued a Bachelor's degree in Nursing and a Master's degree at [Rush University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_University), motivated by a nursing shortage at the time.\n- After working with cancer patients at the Rush Cancer Institute, Dr. Wright decided to pursue a career in research while still wanting to care for patients. This led her to attend medical school at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago) at the age of 28, ultimately choosing the demanding field of [orthopedic surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery), which required an additional 11 years of training.\n\n## What's Orthopedic Surgery? [(00:11:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=717s)\n- Orthopedic surgery encompasses the lifelong care of the musculoskeletal system, which includes bones, tendons, ligaments, muscles, adipose tissue, and joints. \n- This field covers a wide range of conditions, from cancer care to sports injuries, and includes subspecialties like hand, foot, and sports surgery.\n- Dr. Vonda Wright, a sports surgeon, emphasizes a holistic approach to patient care, focusing on the whole person rather than just the surgical procedure. This approach stems from her early experiences caring for patients facing life-threatening illnesses.\n\n## The Importance Of Healthy Mind During An Injury Recovery [(00:13:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=800s)\n- The importance of a holistic approach to patient care is emphasized, considering not just the physical injury but also the psychological and social aspects of the patient's life. This is illustrated through examples of a young athlete dealing with a knee injury and a midlife woman experiencing a frozen shoulder. \n- The text highlights the impact of emotional and social factors on recovery. The young athlete's anxiety about his future as an athlete and the lack of support from his family are mentioned as significant factors affecting his recovery. Similarly, the midlife woman's concerns about her physical and mental health are linked to hormonal changes and the stress of midlife.\n- The text emphasizes the importance of addressing the whole person, not just the injury. This includes considering the patient's nutrition, sleep, and emotional well-being. The speaker emphasizes that a holistic approach is crucial for optimal recovery and overall well-being.\n\n## Taking Care Of The Whole Person Not Just Their Disease [(00:16:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=1013s)\n- Dr. Wright's empathy stems from her time as a cancer nurse, where she witnessed the struggles of patients battling life-threatening illnesses. This experience, particularly the story of a woman who waited for her family to arrive before passing away, deeply impacted her perspective on life and death.\n- This experience instilled in her a strong sense of purpose and a desire to help people. It made her realize that life is precious and that people deserve to be cared for holistically, not just treated for their disease.\n- This perspective translates into her work as a sports doctor, where she focuses on the whole person, not just the injury. She considers the patient's emotional well-being, their social environment, and their future goals, ensuring they receive comprehensive care that helps them recover and thrive.\n\n## How I Changed My View On Death [(00:22:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=1367s)\n- Dr. Wright believes that everyone will die, and she doesn't view death as something to fear. She acknowledges that the speed and circumstances of death can impact how we feel about life, but ultimately, death is inevitable.\n- Dr. Wright believes that death can be a kind and dignified experience, especially in cases of severe trauma or illness. She emphasizes the importance of being surrounded by loved ones during the end of life, as seen in the example of the woman in the bed with her sister.\n- Dr. Wright acknowledges the fear of dying alone, especially for those without children or siblings. She expresses her desire to have loved ones around her when she dies and highlights the importance of building strong relationships and connections throughout life.\n\n## Extending Your Health Span [(00:24:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=1491s)\n- The foundation for extending healthspan begins in childhood. Dr. Wright emphasizes the importance of teaching children healthy habits, including physical activity and proper nutrition, from a young age. She argues that children's mitochondrial health, which is crucial for metabolic function, is significantly influenced by their activity levels during their formative years. \n- Parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's health habits. While acknowledging the challenges of parenting, Dr. Wright stresses that children learn by observing their parents. She encourages parents to model healthy behaviors, such as foam rolling and eating vegetables, to instill these habits in their children.\n- The mid-30s to mid-40s represent a critical decade for healthspan. Dr. Wright identifies this period as a turning point, as individuals have likely reached their peak bone and muscle mass. This signifies the importance of prioritizing health and wellness during this time to maximize healthspan and prevent age-related decline.\n\n## Why You Need To Look After Your Bones & Muscles At 30-40s [(00:27:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=1630s)\n- Peak muscle and bone mass is reached around age 30. After this point, muscle and bone mass naturally decline unless we actively work to maintain or increase them. \n- The 30s and 40s are a critical decade for health. This is the time to prioritize health and wellness, especially for women, as hormonal changes begin to occur. \n- Investing in health and mobility is crucial. Regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle can help slow the decline of muscle and bone mass, and improve overall health. Without this investment, muscle mass and cardiovascular health decline significantly, leading to a more rapid decline in overall health.\n\n## What's Lean Muscle Mass? [(00:30:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=1847s)\n- [Lean muscle mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_body_mass) refers to [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) mass, which is responsible for movement and is metabolically active. It plays a crucial role in controlling various bodily processes, including hormone production and energy generation. \n- A study comparing MRI scans of 40-year-old athletes and 74-year-old sedentary individuals revealed a stark difference in muscle composition. The athletes exhibited lean muscle with minimal fat infiltration, resembling a \"flank steak\" with no marbling. In contrast, the sedentary individual displayed significant fat infiltration and a thick layer of peripheral fat, resembling \"Colby beef.\"\n- The study also included a 70-year-old triathlete, whose muscle architecture closely resembled that of the 40-year-old athlete. This demonstrates that consistent physical activity can preserve muscle mass and strength, even in older age. The study's findings highlight the importance of regular exercise for maintaining healthy aging and preventing muscle loss and fat infiltration.\n\n## What's The Best Exercise Regime To Stay Young [(00:36:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=2204s)\n- Muscle strength is crucial for healthy aging: Dr. Wright emphasizes that muscle strength, particularly in the lower body, is essential for maintaining independence and mobility as we age. She argues that building muscle strength through exercise can help prevent the decline in muscle mass that often occurs with age.\n- Focus on both strength and power: Dr. Wright recommends focusing on both strength and power training for the lower body. Strength training, using heavier weights and fewer repetitions, helps build muscle mass. Power training, using lighter weights and more repetitions, improves muscle function and helps with everyday activities.\n- Balance and agility are equally important: Dr. Wright stresses the importance of balance and agility training to prevent falls, which are a major risk factor for injury and loss of independence in older adults. She suggests incorporating foot speed and agility drills into exercise routines to improve coordination and reaction time.\n\n## The Importance Of Strong Muscles When Old [(00:41:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=2472s)\n- Strong muscles are crucial for preventing falls and injuries, especially as we age. Dr. Wright emphasizes the importance of maintaining [muscle strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) to avoid serious consequences like hip fractures.\n- A hip fracture can have devastating consequences for older adults. Not only can it lead to a lengthy recovery period, but it can also significantly impact mobility and independence, potentially requiring a move to assisted living.\n- Muscle strength is essential for maintaining mobility and independence. Dr. Wright stresses the importance of weight training, particularly for the legs and rear end, to improve strength, speed, and agility, ultimately reducing the risk of falls and fractures.\n\n## The Sedentary Death Syndrome [(00:42:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=2548s)\n- The \"sitting epidemic\" refers to the excessive amount of time spent sitting in modern society, whether at work, playing on phones, or watching television. This sedentary lifestyle contributes to a condition known as \"sedentary death syndrome.\"\n- Sedentary death syndrome is a term coined by a professor at Columbia University in [Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri) to describe the 33 chronic diseases that are linked to prolonged sitting, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and even fractures.\n- Research conducted at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh) has shown that eliminating sedentary living can have a positive impact on bone health, muscle health, and brain health. These studies provide hope that increasing mobility can significantly improve overall health and well-being.\n\n## 80% Of The Population Will Have Back Problems [(00:44:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=2667s)\n- The speaker discusses a friend who recently suffered a back injury, prompting a conversation about back problems and sitting habits.\n- The speaker references a study of the [Hadza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people) tribe in [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa), a hunter-gatherer group that spends a significant amount of time squatting rather than sitting in chairs.\n- The speaker highlights that back problems are prevalent in Western societies, with an estimated 80% of [Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans) experiencing them, while the Hadza tribe rarely encounters such issues. This difference is attributed to the constant muscle activation and proper posture associated with squatting.\n\n## How To Avoid Future Body Aches [(00:46:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=2811s)\n- To avoid future body aches, Dr. Wright recommends incorporating movement into your daily routine, even if you have a desk job.\n- She suggests using a standing desk, taking frequent mobility breaks, and being fidgety throughout the day.\n- Dr. Wright also encourages incorporating simple exercises like wall squats, even during phone calls or [Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications) meetings, to keep your body active and prevent stiffness.\n\n## What To Do About Body Stiffness [(00:47:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=2877s)\n- The speaker describes their experience of stiffness and inflexibility, particularly in their back, which they attribute to their age. They express frustration with their lack of flexibility and wonder if it's due to joint pain or weak core muscles.\n- The speaker emphasizes the importance of daily mobility exercises, highlighting four key components: flexibility and dynamic stretching. They explain that dynamic stretching involves warming up every joint in the body, using exercises like jumping jacks and inchworms. This helps prepare the joints for a full range of motion.\n- The speaker also mentions the importance of static stretching after a workout, emphasizing that it should not be done before exercise. Static stretching involves holding a stretch for a period of time, which helps improve flexibility and range of motion.\n\n## What's Static Stretching? [(00:49:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=2973s)\n- Static stretching is a crucial component of a healthy workout regimen. It involves holding a stretch for 30 seconds without bouncing, targeting major muscle groups like triceps, hamstrings, and calves. This type of stretching is essential for flexibility and can help prevent injuries.\n- Static stretching should be incorporated after dynamic warm-ups and weightlifting. It's recommended to perform four repetitions of each stretch, focusing on relaxing into the stretch and achieving a deeper range of motion.\n- While [Pilates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates) and yoga are beneficial for flexibility, they are not sufficient on their own. Static stretching should be included as a complementary practice to ensure optimal flexibility and prevent joint pain.\n\n## Can We Revert Joint Pain? [(00:52:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=3151s)\n- Joint pain is not inevitable, although it is common with aging. It occurs when the cartilage, which acts as a cushion between bones, is damaged or worn down.\n- There are two main causes of joint pain: traumatic cartilage injury, which happens due to sudden impact, and osteoarthritis, which is caused by gradual wear and tear over time.\n- Osteoarthritis can be influenced by genetics, weight, and hormone levels, particularly estrogen in women. Since we only get one set of cartilage in our lifetime, it's important to protect it and prevent further damage.\n\n## Don't Do This When You Exercise! [(00:54:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=3294s)\n- Progressive overload is key for joint health: Starting with light weights and gradually increasing the load helps your joints adapt and become stronger, preventing inflammation and pain. Avoid jumping into heavy lifting without proper preparation.\n- Muscle acts as a shock absorber: Building muscle mass helps protect your joints by cushioning the impact of movement. This is especially important for people with osteoarthritis.\n- Weight loss significantly reduces joint pressure: Even small changes in body weight can have a dramatic impact on joint pressure. Losing 10% of your body weight can significantly reduce pain and improve joint health. This is because the weight of your body is amplified by the mechanics of your bones, meaning a 1-pound weight gain can exert 9 pounds of pressure on your joints.\n\n## Losing Abdominal Fat [(01:00:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=3607s)\n- Shifting focus from weight loss to muscle building: Dr. Wright emphasizes that focusing solely on weight loss, particularly [abdominal fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity), is not the most effective approach to healthy aging. Instead, she advocates for a shift in mindset towards building muscle, which is crucial for metabolic health and overall well-being.\n- Recomposing body composition: Dr. Wright suggests reframing the goal as \"recomposing\" the body, aiming to increase muscle mass while decreasing fat percentage. This approach prioritizes a healthy body composition over a specific number on the scale.\n- Calorie restriction's negative impact: She highlights the detrimental effects of calorie restriction without proper exercise. This method often leads to significant muscle loss, which negatively impacts metabolism and increases the likelihood of regaining weight as fat. Dr. Wright emphasizes that building muscle is essential for maintaining a healthy metabolism and burning fat.\n\n## Can We Get As In Shape As When We Were 25? [(01:02:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=3768s)\n- It is possible to be in better shape in your 40s than you were in your 20s. There are many examples of people who have maintained or even improved their fitness levels as they age. Professional athletes like [Tom Brady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady) and [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo) are prime examples, but even everyday people can achieve this through dedication to exercise and healthy eating.\n- Maintaining fitness requires discipline and consistency. The text highlights the stark contrast between Cristiano Ronaldo's physique and that of a fellow [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.) player who is the same age. While both were in good shape in their 30s, the latter player's fitness declined due to a shift in lifestyle choices, including diet and alcohol consumption. This demonstrates how even a few years of neglecting healthy habits can significantly impact one's physical appearance and health.\n- It's never too late to get back in shape. Even if someone has let their fitness slip, they can still regain their strength and physique by recommitting to a healthy lifestyle. The text suggests that the Manchester United player who has fallen behind could still achieve a ripped physique if he were to dedicate himself to exercise and proper nutrition.\n\n## How Cristiano Ronaldo Stays That Fit & Healthy [(01:05:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=3943s)\n- Cristiano Ronaldo's fitness and longevity are a result of a strategic approach to training and recovery, prioritizing quality over quantity. He likely focuses on targeted skill workouts and maximum effort within a shorter timeframe, emphasizing recovery and muscle work.\n- Nutrition plays a crucial role in Ronaldo's success, with a highly regimented diet designed to fuel and recover his body. This includes carefully planned meals, snacks, and even food provided during travel.\n- Ronaldo's training regimen extends beyond skill-based workouts to include meticulously monitored conditioning exercises. This involves tracking recovery states, sleep quality, and response to heavy lifting, ensuring optimal performance and minimizing injury risk.\n\n## Sugar Impact On Our Body [(01:07:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=4070s)\n- Sugar is highly addictive and can have detrimental effects on the body. Dr. Wright emphasizes that sugar is addictive and can lead to cravings, even after a period of detox. She explains that sugar triggers a dopamine release in the brain, creating a pleasurable sensation that reinforces the desire for more.\n- Simple sugars, like those found in beet sugar, cane sugar, honey, and agave, are harmful due to their high glycemic index. These sugars are rapidly digested and cause a spike in blood sugar levels. This spike triggers the release of insulin, which attempts to transport the sugar into muscles for energy. However, when the sugar intake exceeds the body's ability to process it, the excess is stored as fat.\n- High blood sugar levels contribute to inflammation and insulin resistance. The excess sugar in the bloodstream leads to a process called glycosylation, where proteins in the body become caramelized, similar to overcooked meat. This process is highly inflammatory and contributes to chronic diseases. Additionally, the constant overproduction of insulin to manage high blood sugar levels can lead to insulin resistance, where the body becomes less responsive to the hormone.\n\n## How To Apply All These Knowledge To One's Self [(01:10:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=4257s)\n- Temporal Disconnect: The speaker explains the concept of \"temporal disconnect,\" which is the tendency to prioritize immediate gratification over long-term benefits. This is why people struggle to make healthy choices, as they focus on the present discomfort rather than the future rewards of a healthy lifestyle.\n- Focus on Immediate Rewards: The speaker suggests that instead of focusing on the distant future, people should focus on the immediate benefits of healthy choices. For example, instead of thinking about the long-term benefits of exercise, focus on how good it will make you feel in the present moment.\n- Self-Worth and Investment: The speaker emphasizes the importance of self-worth in making healthy choices. If you believe you are worth the daily investment in your health, you are more likely to prioritize it. The speaker also highlights the compounding effect of healthy choices, emphasizing that the decisions you make today will have a significant impact on your future health.\n\n## Vitamin D Supplements [(01:16:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=4564s)\n- The speaker discusses the importance of vitamin D supplementation, particularly for individuals who spend a lot of time indoors and have limited exposure to sunlight. He mentions that his own vitamin D levels were found to be low during a recent medical check-up.\n- Vitamin D is a crucial hormone that plays a vital role in maintaining healthy bones, immune function, and brain health. The speaker emphasizes the need for everyone to get their vitamin D levels checked and supplement accordingly.\n- He recommends taking vitamin D with potassium and magnesium to enhance absorption. For optimal bone health, he suggests consuming one gram of protein per ideal body pound, incorporating regular exercise that involves impact and stress on bones, and considering supplements like boron and zinc.\n\n## Strengthening Our Bone Structure [(01:18:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=4738s)\n- Bone density can be improved: A T-score, measured through a DEXA scan, compares your bone density to that of a healthy 30-year-old. You can improve your T-score through weightlifting, proper nutrition, and managing hormone levels (especially estrogen for women).\n- Osteoporosis is a serious condition: A T-score of -2.5 indicates osteoporosis, meaning your bones are dangerously brittle. This is a significant concern, as two million men in the US alone have osteoporosis.\n- [FRAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRAX) index assesses fracture risk: The FRAX index considers lifestyle factors like family history, smoking, and steroid use to calculate your risk of fracture in the next 10 years. A high FRAX score, combined with a low T-score, may warrant medication to maintain or build bone density. An endocrinologist can help determine the best course of action.\n\n## What To Do If You Have Weak Bones? [(01:22:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=4953s)\n- If your bone density score is minus two or lower, it's crucial to address the issue proactively.\n- Lifestyle interventions, including nutrition, weightlifting, and mobility exercises, are essential to improve bone health.\n- Depending on the severity of the situation, hormone status and the use of medications like bisphosphonates or [Forteo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teriparatide) may be discussed to support bone density.\n\n## Our Biology Is Ticking Over [(01:23:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=5012s)\n- Bone density can be preserved with regular exercise: Studies on Master's athletes showed that those who engaged in impact exercises, like running and basketball, maintained bone density even into their 80s. This highlights the importance of mechanical stimulus for bone health.\n- Athletic performance declines significantly after the mid-70s: The study found that athletes slow down less than 1.2% per year before age 70, but experience a rapid decline in performance after that age. This suggests that our bodies are capable of maintaining high levels of physical function for a long time, but there is a biological limit.\n- Exercise benefits brain health and longevity: Studies comparing active and sedentary individuals showed that those who were chronically active maintained better mental agility, decision-making speed, and physical prowess. Furthermore, the study found that Master's athletes had higher levels of the longevity protein \"clo,\" which is stimulated by muscle contraction. This suggests that exercise not only improves physical health but also promotes longevity.\n\n## Findings About Muscles [(01:31:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=5489s)\n- Muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells, are crucial for muscle growth and repair. These cells are found within muscle tissue and are responsible for producing new muscle cells.\n- Aging negatively impacts muscle stem cells. In older mice, these stem cells become spindly and lose their ability to replicate and produce growth factors. They also activate genes that lead to cell death.\n- Exercise can rejuvenate muscle stem cells. The study found that even short periods of exercise, such as running on a treadmill twice a day for two weeks, significantly improved the health of muscle stem cells in older mice. These cells began to replicate, produce growth factors, and shut down the genes responsible for cell death. This suggests that exercise can have a profound impact on muscle health at the cellular level.\n\n## Comfort Is Making Us Age [(01:34:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=5645s)\n- The speaker suggests that aging is often driven by a pursuit of comfort. This means that as we age, we tend to prioritize ease and convenience over challenging ourselves physically and mentally.\n- The speaker argues that we spend a significant amount of time pursuing comfort, even when it comes to exercise. They suggest that most people can achieve their fitness goals with just 45 minutes of exercise per day, leaving a large portion of the day for comfort-seeking activities.\n- The speaker encourages viewers to reframe self-care as a source of pleasure, rather than just comfort. They emphasize that temporary discomfort, such as the soreness experienced after a challenging workout, can lead to a sense of accomplishment and well-being.\n\n## How Does Menopause Affect Our Musculoskeletal Functioning [(01:37:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=5829s)\n- Menopause significantly impacts musculoskeletal functioning, with 80% of women experiencing the \"musculoskeletal syndrome of menopause.\" This syndrome is characterized by inflammation and pain in various musculoskeletal tissues, including muscles, tendons, and bones.\n- Estrogen plays a crucial role in reducing inflammation by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor. During menopause, estrogen levels decline, leading to increased inflammation and pain in musculoskeletal tissues.\n- The musculoskeletal syndrome of menopause can be debilitating for some women, with 25% experiencing severe symptoms. However, it's important to note that often, imaging tests reveal no structural abnormalities, leading to frustration and a sense of being dismissed. This syndrome highlights the importance of understanding the hormonal changes associated with menopause and their impact on musculoskeletal health.\n\n## What Is Menopause? [(01:39:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=5958s)\n- Menopause is defined as one year after a woman's last menstrual cycle. This marks the end of a woman's reproductive years and the beginning of a period of significant hormonal changes.\n- The primary symptom of menopause is the loss of estrogen. This hormone plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including muscle building, bone health, and inflammation control. Without estrogen, women experience a range of symptoms, including brain fog, joint pain, and weight gain.\n- One of the most common musculoskeletal symptoms of menopause is frozen shoulder. This condition is caused by inflammation of the shoulder capsule, which can lead to pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. Frozen shoulder can take up to two years to resolve and can significantly impact a woman's daily life.\n\n## How To Keep Healthy And Strong [(01:49:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=6572s)\n- To feel like yourself again, women need to understand that they can regain their health and vitality. This involves making informed decisions about hormone replacement therapy, prioritizing mobility and strength training, and adopting a smart anti-inflammatory diet.\n- Hormone replacement therapy should be based on scientific evidence and individual needs. The decision to replace estrogen should not be driven by fear or myths. It can help preserve bone, muscle, brain, and heart health.\n- Investing in mobility and strength training is crucial for feeling better. Women should lift heavy weights, focusing on compound movements like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and pull-downs. This helps build muscle and improve overall strength. Cardiovascular training should include both base training at a lower heart rate and high-intensity sprints for short bursts. This combination burns more fat and stimulates muscle growth.\n\n## What Makes Your Glucose Spike? [(01:56:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=6968s)\n- Dr. Vonda Wright, a healthy aging doctor, shares her experience with a continuous glucose monitor, which she wore for two weeks while filming a TV show.\n- She discovered that she is extremely sensitive to simple [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate), experiencing a significant glucose spike even after consuming a small amount.\n- Dr. Wright acknowledges that while she is sensitive to simple carbs, she also needs energy and has found that adding sourdough to her breakfast, despite causing a small spike, provides her with the energy she needs.\n\n## What's A Simple Carb? [(01:57:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=7029s)\n- Simple carbohydrates are defined as sugars, ice cream, white bread, white potatoes, and white pasta. These are considered \"good stuff\" but are not beneficial for long-term health.\n- The most important concept for a healthy lifespan is temporal disconnect, which means considering the future consequences of our current actions. Dr. Wright emphasizes the importance of thinking ahead and making choices today that will allow us to live a healthy and independent life in the future.\n- Dr. Wright uses the example of wanting to be around to \"bug\" her daughter until she is her age, which would require her to live to 97. This motivates her to prioritize healthy habits now, even though she doesn't always enjoy them. She also highlights the importance of maintaining cardiovascular health, as it is crucial for independence and avoiding frailty in old age.\n\n## The Importance Of A Good VO2 Max [(01:59:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=7190s)\n- [VO2 Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max) is a measure of your cardiovascular capacity, indicating how well your body can utilize oxygen. It is important to know your VO2 Max, especially as you age, as it declines by 10% every decade without intervention.\n- The average VO2 Max for a 50-year-old man is 55, and for a 50-year-old woman is 31. Elite athletes can have VO2 Maxes above 75, even reaching 200 in some cases.\n- Maintaining or improving your VO2 Max is crucial for healthy aging. While you can't completely prevent the decline, you can mitigate it through exercise. Dr. Wright recommends a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) approach, involving short bursts of intense effort followed by recovery periods. This method can be effective even with just three sessions per week.\n\n## Last Guest Question [(02:02:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6wTuogebU8&t=7342s)\n- Dr. Vonda Wright emphasizes the importance of a strong \"why\" when it comes to building healthy habits. She explains that having a clear and compelling reason for pursuing a goal, like wanting to be healthy enough to be a present father for her children, can significantly increase motivation and overcome friction.\n- Dr. Wright shares her personal experience with inconsistent gym routines and how the realization that health is the foundation for everything else in life changed her perspective. This realization became her non-negotiable, leading to a consistent commitment to her health.\n- Dr. Wright discusses her recent decision to leave the comfort of a secure career in academic [orthopedic surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery) to pursue her own entrepreneurial ventures. This move, taken at the age of 57, was a significant risk but one she felt confident in taking, driven by her belief in her abilities and a desire to build something for herself.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=0s)\n- [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) consistently demonstrates longevity and health span benefits across various species, including yeast, worms, fruit flies, mice, and pet dogs.\n  \n## David & Matt’s expertise in mTOR & rapamycin [(00:01:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=60s)\n- David has extensively researched rapamycin and its effects on the [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) pathway, focusing on nutrient sensing and its relations to anabolism and catabolism.\n- Matt's contributions to the field include discovering mTOR's impacts on aging through unbiased genetic research, leading to further exploration into rapamycin's potential as a longevity therapeutic.\n- Both are recognized as leading authorities on mTOR and rapamycin, with David's work being more mechanistically focused and Matt's trending towards translational research.\n- Their complementary expertise spans the continuum of scientific benchwork to potential clinical applications, respecting the complexity of the [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) signaling network.\n- The field's credibility is upheld by their scientific rigor and cautious approach to commercialization, setting a standard for research into potential aging therapeutics.\n\n## The discovery of rapamycin & first use in humans as an immunosuppressant [(00:12:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=720s)\n- Rapamycin was discovered in a soil sample from [Easter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island) (Rapa Nui) by pharmaceutical company Wyeth Ayerst.\n- The compound came from a bacterium called *[Streptomyces hygroscopicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomyces_hygroscopicus)* and was named after Easter Island where it was found.\n- Initially, rapamycin showed antifungal properties and later was used as an immunosuppressant.\n- Its clinical development path was long, with approval for human use coming decades after its discovery.\n- The long clinical path and its initial use as an immunosuppressant may have negatively impacted the reputation and development for other uses.\n  \n## Emergence of rapamycin as a molecule with the potential to prolong lifespan [(00:19:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=1145s)\n- The connection between rapamycin and nutrients led scientists to consider its potential impact on lifespan, building on existing knowledge about caloric restriction and aging.\n- The Interventions Testing Program's (ITP) study in 2009 showed that rapamycin extended lifespan in mice, a significant finding linking yeast and mammalian aging.\n- No other small molecules except for caloric restriction and potentially [Alpha-ketoglutarate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Α-Ketoglutaric_acid) have shown consistent lifespan extension across a broad evolutionary spectrum of organisms.\n- Genetic inhibition of the mTOR pathway, which rapamycin affects, similarly extends lifespan and health span in various model organisms.\n- There is substantial evolutionary conservation in genetic control of longevity, which supports the study of fundamental biological aging processes and their translation to human aging.\n\n## Groundbreaking rapamycin study on mouse lifespan extension & the open questions about the timing & frequency of dosing [(00:25:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=1553s)\n- [Geroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontology) focuses on fundamental aging interventions unlike disease-specific treatments.\n- The 2009 [NIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Aging) study showed rapamycin could extend the lifespan when started in middle-aged mice.\n- This finding was serendipitous due to delays in formulating rapamycin in mouse food.\n- Treating middle-aged organisms is more practical for potential human applications.\n- Starting rapamycin in middle age is beneficial, but the ideal initiation time and dosing are unknown. \n- There is a lack of comprehensive dose-response studies due to high costs and funding challenges.\n\n## Research funding challenges and the importance of high-risk studies [Discussion throughout]\n- Current biomedical research funding is risk-averse, often hindering high-impact studies.\n- The accidental discovery with rapamycin suggests a need for funding high-risk, high-reward research.\n- Intermittent dosing studies in ITP mice could inform treatments in larger animals and humans.\n- Such studies, while costly, are considered valuable and could potentially find funding outside [NIH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health).\n- Exploring other mTOR inhibitors and dosing strategies is critical but underfunded.\n- The current NIH funding structure does not prioritize these types of pragmatic, translational studies.\n\n## Explaining mTOR & the biology behind rapamycin’s effects [(00:36:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=2186s)\n- Rapamycin is a unique drug that binds to a cellular protein [FKBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FKBP1A) and then attaches it to [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR), affecting its function.\n- mTOR is a kinase involved in anabolism (building up) and catabolism (breaking down), including autophagy, the self-eating process of the cell.\n- The discovery that mTOR needs to be bound to other proteins to be active was significant. Detergents used in experiments initially disrupted these complexes.\n- Proteins like Raptor and Richter are components of the [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) complexes known as mTORC1 and[ mTORC2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1), respectively, and they play roles in cellular and organismal lifespan.\n- mTORC1 is connected to many upstream signals and downstream targets, with thousands of mTOR complexes present in a typical cell.\n- mTOR resides at the [lysosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome), which is critical for nutrient sensing and cellular metabolism.\n- [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) is evenly distributed across various tissues and is considered integral to cellular health.\n- [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) is an allosteric inhibitor that blocks the entrance where substrates would normally bind to [mTORC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1), affecting its function by steric hindrance while allowing smaller substrates to pass.\n- Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are affected differently by various types of inhibitors, with rapamycin primarily affecting [mTORC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1).\n\n## Differences in how rapamycin inhibits mTOR complex 1 (MTORC1) versus mTOR complex 2 (MTORC2) [(00:47:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=2833s) \n- Rapamycin partially inhibits MTORC1 and can, over time, partially inhibit MTORC2.\n- MTORC1 and MTORC2 have different canonical substrates; for [MTORC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1), it's [S6 kinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P70-S6_Kinase_1), and for MTORC2, it's a protein called [AKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKT1).\n- FKBP-rapamycin can bind to \"naked\" MTOR and prevent the formation of MTORC2 by blocking the necessary interaction between MTOR and Richter.\n- Prolonged rapamycin exposure leads to the binding of FKBP-rapamycin to [MTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR), thus inhibiting the formation of new MTORC2 complexes.\n- The inhibition mechanisms for MTORC1 and MTORC2 through rapamycin are distinct, with MTORC1 being directly inhibited, while MTORC2 is prevented from forming when rapamycin binds to MTOR prior to MTORC2 assembly.\n\n## Reconciling the biochemical mechanism of rapamycin with its longevity benefit [(00:51:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=3080s)\n- Longevity benefits of rapamycin are seen with both chronic and intermittent dosing, despite the biochemical mechanism's complexity.\n- Rapamycin impacts life and health span potentially due to [MTORC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1) inhibition, but the complete mechanisms are not yet fully understood.\n- Genetic data from various organisms suggest that benefits are associated with MTORC1 inhibition, but the evidence is not comprehensive.\n- The idea that longevity benefits come only from MTORC1 inhibition and side effects from MTORC2 inhibition is still under investigation.\n- Low levels of rapamycin are used in longevity studies, which might not inhibit MTORC2 as much, allowing some cells to escape inhibition.\n- The rapamycin dosing is less constant in a living organism as compared to controlled experiments, suggesting transient exposure might be sufficient for benefits.\n- Determining the specific contributions of [MTORC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTORC1) and MTORC2 inhibition to rapamycin’s benefits is complex due to shared components and a lack of clean experimental tools.\n- The network of signaling regulated by MTORC is dynamic and adaptive, continuously seeking homeostasis despite pharmacological interventions.\n\n## Important discoveries about the interplay of amino acids (leucine in particular) & mTOR [(00:56:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=3402s)\n- [David Sabatini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Sabatini) discovered mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) in [Saul Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_H._Snyder)'s lab and initially overlooked the importance of cell biology in understanding [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR)'s function.\n- Using an antibody, he observed mTOR's unique punctate pattern in cells, but the specific cellular location was unclear until years later.\n- After many years, Tim Peterson in Sabatini's lab discovered that mTOR resides on lysosomes, which are cellular compartments responsible for breaking down materials into basic components like amino acids.\n- Peterson's experiment showed that amino acids' presence or absence could move [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) on and off lysosomes, indicating nutrients' role in mTOR localization.\n- A complex network of about 20 proteins communicates with nutrients to anchor mTOR to the surface of lysosomes via a docking station.\n- Joe Avruch's research identified leucine and arginine as key amino acids regulating [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR), prior to the discovery of mTOR's association with lysosomes.\n- David Sabatini's lab pursued how leucine, known for increasing satiety and muscle mass, was detected by cells.\n- They identified [sestrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SESN2) as the protein receptor for leucine, which was a significant breakthrough, and observed leucine binding in the structure of sestrin.\n- Rachel Wolfson and Lynn Chantranupong discovered sestrin as the leucine sensor; Bobby Saxton and Thomas Schwartz elucidated the crystal structure of leucine bound to [sestrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SESN2).\n- The structure showed leucine's snug fit within sestrin, explaining why it is challenging to mimic leucine's anabolic effects with other compounds.\n- Leucine's binding and release from sestrin may involve a lid that closes over it and possibly requires phosphorylation to reopen, suggesting an active release mechanism.\n\n## Reconciling rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition with mTOR's significance in building & maintaining muscle [(01:04:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=3883s)\n- mTOR is essential for nutrient sensing and muscle mass, and its activation promotes muscle building.\n- [Sarcopenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopenia), or low muscle mass, is a significant risk for both lifespan and health span.\n- [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) inhibits [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR), expected to lead to muscle loss, but has been observed to preserve muscle mass in rodents.\n- The dose of rapamycin likely impacts whether it leads to muscle loss or preservation.\n- At lifespan-extending doses, rapamycin may preserve muscle mass in the context of aging.\n- It's unclear whether lower doses of rapamycin would impede muscle building in humans during resistance training.\n- Rapamycin's effect on chronic inflammation might preserve muscle by reducing inflammation-related muscle synthesis impairment.\n- There are differences between rodent models and humans regarding sarcopenia, urging caution when extrapolating findings from mouse studies to human health.\n\n## Unanswered questions around the tissue specificity of rapamycin [(01:12:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=4320s)\n- High doses of rapamycin can inhibit mTOR in all examined tissues, but CNS penetration is more challenging, requiring multiple doses.\n- At lower doses, as used in lifespan and healthspan studies, the effect on different tissues may vary.\n- There is a need to understand which tissues are most affected by low-dose rapamycin related to lifespan impact.\n- Studies have not been done systematically to determine mTOR's role in individual tissues regarding aging.\n- No biological system is immune to aging, implying a need for tissue-specific information under low-dose rapamycin treatment.\n- Rapamycin does not uniformly affect all [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) substrates, and its inhibition varies across tissues and doses, raising more questions about its tissue-specific effects during aging.\n\n## Rapamycin’s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier & its potential impacts on brain health & neurodegeneration [(01:18:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=4689s) \n- Efficacy of rapamycin in crossing the blood-brain barrier ([BBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier)) is debated; effective inhibition of mTOR complex 1 in the brain occurs at higher doses.\n- The BBB may weaken with age, potentially allowing better penetration of rapamycin in older individuals; however, direct data on this is lacking.\n- [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) has a relatively large size for a small molecule (around 1000 Daltons) which could impact its ability to traverse the BBB.\n- Its lipophilic nature is likely more relevant to its ability to cross into the brain, potentially becoming trapped in lipid-rich areas.\n- Biomarker C2N, used to monitor [amyloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta) levels in humans, suggests that intermittent rapamycin dosing lowered amyloid in plasma for high-risk patients, but causality with brain amyloid levels is unclear.\n- The hypothesis posits that peripheral actions of rapamycin may affect the brain, including possible effects on immune dysregulation and inflammation.\n- Systemic immune dysregulation with age could lead to more immune cells penetrating the [BBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier) and contributing to brain inflammation.\n- Effects on brain disorders could be achieved by targeting mTOR inhibition in peripheral tissues such as the liver.\n- Clinical practice includes using rapamycin for patients with mild cognitive impairment and [amyloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta) beta elevations, as there is no existing effective treatment, and it may improve inflammation and autophagy.\n- [Alzheimer's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease) complexity could mean various subtypes respond differently to rapamycin, emphasizing the need for more clinical research.\n\n## Rapamycin's Transition to Human Use and its Patent History [(01:26:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=5200s)\n- Rapamycin's transition to humans was slow, resulting in minimal profitability and diminished research interest.\n- [Everolimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everolimus), a derivative of rapamycin, is part of the [Novartis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novartis) portfolio.\n- Original patents on rapamycin did not adequately cover derivatives, leading to multiple rapalogs, such as Everolimus.\n- Rapalogs have similar biochemical mechanisms, binding FKBP12 to inhibit [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) complex 1, but differ in bioavailability, tissue distribution, and metabolism.\n\n## Rejuvenation of the Immune System Study and Rapamycin Derivatives\n- Impacts derivatives of rapamycin on the immune system were initially tested in other mammals before humans.\n- The study by Joan Mannick used drug everolimus, showing potential for immune rejuvenation.\n- Rapalogs demonstrated almost identical actions in cell cultures, with subtle variations mostly serving patent strategies.\n- Rapamycin became a generic, off-patent drug early in its lifecycle, yet remained expensive due to a lack of alternatives.\n\n## The Immune Modulating Effects of Rapamycin and its Derivatives \n- Everolimus proved it could enhance immune response to the flu vaccine in older adults without significant side effects.\n- The concept changed from perceiving rapamycin as an immune suppressant to an immune modulator.\n- While initially used as an immunosuppressant for transplants, data in cells and mice did not strongly indicate rapamycin’s effectiveness in this role.\n- No evidence suggests rapamycin increases infections contrary to its immunosuppressive branding.\n\n## Clinical Trial Endpoints for Gero-Therapeutics\n- Clinical studies like Mannick’s are pivotal for finding functional endpoints for [FDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) approval of gero-therapeutic drugs.\n- Trials have shown that older mice and humans can have improved immune response through treatments like rapamycin derivatives.\n- Human trials confirmed that lower doses of rapamycin derivatives are tolerable and may have potential as gero-therapeutics for immune rejuvenation.\n- Future studies of rapamycin and its derivatives might focus on clarifying the distinction between immune modulation and suppression.\n\n## Might rapamycin induce changes in T cell methylation patterns, potentially reversing biological aging? [(01:40:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=6041s)\n- There is agreement that rapamycin would change the epigenome in T cells, but uncertainty if this equates to reversing biological aging.\n- The current understanding and measurement of epigenetic age may not accurately reflect biological aging, raising skepticism around whether rapamycin could reverse epigenetic aging.\n- Research on canonical age-related epigenetic changes in T cells and their link to functional declines is still in early stages.\n- Although impressive immune system changes were observed in mice with mtor inhibition, it remains unclear if this is due to cell cycle delay or a fundamental rewriting of the genetic code.\n- [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus)'s impact could be on the state of the cells, not necessarily on inducing a specific epigenetic change through a defined signal transduction pathway.\n- While rapamycin affects all 12 Hallmarks of Aging, its link to epigenetic changes is weaker compared to other areas like mitochondrial functionality.\n- It's speculated that rapamycin may chiefly reduce hyperactivation of the immune system, therefore resetting its function to respond more like a young immune system to a vaccine.\n- There's evidence that transient treatment with rapamycin can rejuvenate function in other tissues and organs such as the heart, brain, and ovaries, with persistent effects post-treatment.\n\n(As requested, the summary contains only key points from the specific sections of the YouTube video transcript structured into bullet points under the relevant heading.)\n\n## Rapamycin side effects & impacts on mental health: fascinating results of Matt’s survey on off-label rapamycin use [(01:49:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=6540s)\n- Survey compared over 300 off-label rapamycin users with nearly 200 non-users who were equally health-conscious.\n- Both groups had similar demographics and lifestyle habits, likely biased towards health-conscious individuals.\n- Key takeaway: no significant side effects associated with off-label rapamycin use except for mouth sores.\n- Frequency of mouth sores among users was approximately 15%, which aligns with the prevalence in organ transplant patients.\n- The cause of mouth sores might be linked to rapamycin's effect on fast-proliferating epithelial cells and potential disruption of barrier function.\n- No noticeable side effects on hair and nails; however, pre-treatment with rapamycin can mitigate hair loss from chemotherapy in mice.\n- Suggested potential remedies for mouth sores include FK 506 mouthwashes or using inert analogs that bind to [FKBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FKBP1A) without targeting mTOR.\n- Side effects that were lower in rapamycin users included abdominal cramps, depression, and anxiety.\n- Growing evidence suggests rapamycin could have beneficial neurocognitive effects.\n- Discussions around rapamycin's role combined with [ketamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine) for depression and chronic pain, with anecdotal reports indicating enhanced effects or reduced frequency and dosage requirements.\n- Contradictory studies highlight the need for clarity on the interaction between rapamycin, ketamine, and mTOR, especially regarding dosing and administration methods.\n\n## Unanswered questions & future research directions [Expansion on mental health impacts]\n- The precise mechanisms by which rapamycin might relieve depressive and anxiety symptoms are still unclear.\n- The combination of rapamycin with ketamine in clinical settings points to potential therapeutic approaches that warrant further exploration.\n- Discrepancies in existing studies necessitate reexamination to ensure a thorough understanding among researchers and clinicians.\n- The relationship between rapamycin's side effects, dosage, and administration methods remains an area of active inquiry.\n\n## Impact of taking rapamycin in people who contracted COVID-19: more insights from Matt’s survey [(01:59:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=7172s)\n- People taking rapamycin did not show a significant difference in the likelihood of a positive [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) test.\n- Among rapamycin users, there were no observable differences in COVID-19 severity or post-infection symptoms for those who started taking it after their infection.\n- Those who took rapamycin throughout their infection had statistically lower severity rates and a decreased likelihood of long COVID symptoms.\n- Continuous rapamycin use might be beneficial against chronic inflammatory responses linked to severe or long-term COVID-19.\n- The properties of rapamycin could potentially apply to other viral infections, not just [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19).\n\n## What David would like to study with mTOR inhibitors [(02:05:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=7520s)\n- David is interested in studying rapamycin and other [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) inhibitors to induce a metabolic state that can’t be achieved through dietary means.\n- Allosteric inhibitors like rapamycin partially inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 but do not completely stop their activity.\n- Catalytic inhibitors fully suppress mTOR activity but are highly toxic to cells and animals and could potentially cause death.\n- There's interest in the potential for catalytic inhibitors to massively activate autophagy and rewire the system temporarily, possibly having epigenetic impacts.\n- Dietary restriction impacts the mTOR pathway but differs from what can be achieved with rapamycin.\n- The broader effects of dietary restriction, both positive and negative, are not often considered when comparing it to rapamycin use.\n- Catalytic inhibitors often lack specificity for [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR), affecting other kinases, which could underline why they are less ideal for clinical use due to side effects.\n\n## Joan Mannick’s studies of RTB101 & other ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR [(02:09:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=7790s)\n- RTB101 is an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor that also inhibits other kinases.\n- Studies at Restore Bio dosed people with RTB101 without significant side effects, but efficacy was in question as the trial was shut down.\n- In the RTB101 trial, it was combined with everolimus, with two arms in the study: combination and RTB101 alone.\n- RTB101 was originally a Novartis molecule known as NVP-103 with dual mTOR and PI3 kinase inhibiting activities, considered a \"dirty\" molecule with multiple target interactions.\n- Wyeth developed an [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) inhibitor that was exquisitely specific, though [Pfizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer) de-emphasized it upon acquisition.\n- There is curiosity about the relative benefits and side effects profiles of various mTOR inhibitors in animal models, and whether anything is superior to rapamycin for longevity.\n- Catalytic inhibitors, like RTB101, are hydrophobic and challenging to use in dosing for animal experiments.\n  \n- RTB101, in cell culture models, showed antiviral gene expression, providing a rationale for using it in clinical trials related to vaccine response and infection resistance.\n- A decision was made to proceed to a pivotal trial with RTB101 alone, potentially influenced by patent life and a clear path to market.\n- The pivotal trial of RTB101 was halted mid-way as it failed to meet its FDA-mandated endpoint based on patient-reported infections.\n- Post-trial analysis revealed that RTB101 recipients had a significantly lower risk of subsequent infection from influenza viruses and coronaviruses, leaving the drug's failure and its impact on immune function as an open topic.\n- The effectiveness, mechanism of action, and potential issues with the original study of RTB101 remain unclear due to its broad targeting profile.\n\n## Impact of mTOR inhibition on autophagy & inflammation & a discussion of biomarkers [(02:20:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=8410s)\n- mTOR inhibition impacts protein synthesis, which in turn affects various processes, including autophagy, inflammation, and cellular senescence.\n- Autophagy is believed to be a key mechanism through which [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) inhibitors like rapamycin confer their longevity benefits.\n- Inhibition of mTOR can also reduce the production of soluble factors by senescent cells and influence proteomics significantly.\n- Autophagy can be linked to the recycling of cellular components and is directly regulated by mTOR through pathways such as those involving the transcription factor TFEB, which promotes lysosome production.\n- Impact on aging is also due to [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR)'s role as a general regulator that modifies many different processes, which is important because aging affects nearly all cellular components.\n- Different downstream effects of mTOR may be significant in various contexts or diseases, e.g., cell size in hypertrophy or cell cycle in cancer.\n- In C. elegans models, the longevity benefits of mTOR inhibition seem to be mostly attributed to autophagy activation, but in yeast, effects on mRNA translation are predominant.\n- In mammals, including humans, anti-inflammatory effects of [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) inhibitors like rapamycin might account for many functional benefits seen with age, particularly through the reduction of sterile inflammation.\n- There is an identified need for better biomarkers to capture the impact of drugs like rapamycin on processes such as inflammation and autophagy, but current markers for autophagy are notably insufficient compared to those available for inflammation.\n\n## The Dog Aging Project: What We’ve Learned From Testing Rapamycin in Dogs [(02:28:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=8904s)\n- Companion animals, specifically dogs, are valuable for aging studies because they share our environment and are not genetically inbred like lab mice.\n- Dogs age faster than humans, allowing for timely clinical trials to measure aging-related outcomes.\n- More than half of the population views pets as family members, making their health span and longevity a worthy study focus.\n- The [Dog Aging Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Aging_Project) assesses rapamycin's effects on dogs' lifespan and health metrics in a rigorous clinical trial that began 7-12 years ago.\n- The study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a cohort of 580 dogs to detect a 9% change in overall lifespan.\n- Candidates for the study are dogs that are at least seven years old, weigh between 40 and 110 pounds, and have no significant pre-existing age-related diseases.\n- Lifespan is the primary endpoint, but health metrics such as cardiac, neurological, and cognitive functions are also evaluated.\n- Results may translate to human biology and contribute to the understanding of rapamycin's potential as a longevity extension therapy.\n\n## Preliminary Results of Primate Studies With Rapamycin [(02:36:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=9380s)\n- Non-human primate studies, specifically with marmosets, provide important insights since they have a shorter lifespan than rhesus monkeys.\n- Preliminary data indicates potential lifespan extension due to rapamycin treatment in marmosets.\n- The primate study conducted in captivity may have limitations related to environmental factors compared to real-world scenarios.\n- It is acknowledged that the effects of rapamycin in a controlled lab environment could differ from those in a non-lab, free-living setting.\n- The potential benefits in marmosets are promising but must be considered with caution due to the controlled study conditions, which may not fully represent the daily challenges faced in more natural settings.\n\n## Dosing of rapamycin [(02:39:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=9571s)\n- Initial study tested rapamycin doses of 0.1 mg/kg thrice a week and 0.05 mg/kg thrice a week.\n- Follow-up dosing protocol settled at 0.15 mg/kg once a week for a large clinical trial.\n- Decision based on prior outcomes, desire to mimic the once-weekly dosing seen in everolimus studies, and practical considerations for pet owners.\n- Concerns include the dose being too low to see significant effects, balancing risk aversion in pet studies.\n- Mouse studies used a much higher dosage of rapamycin compared to what is extrapolated for human dosing.\n- Most off-label human users take rapamycin once weekly, primarily 6 mg, due to historical precedent and community consensus.\n- Some individuals take much higher doses up to 20 mg once a week, often adjusting over time to gauge side effects.\n- Concurrent intake of grapefruit juice observed among some users to increase bioavailability of rapamycin.\n- Warnings against using compounded formulations of rapamycin due to potential issues with Purity and bioavailability unless there are FDA certificates.\n- Importance of enteric-coated capsules for rapamycin to ensure bioavailability given its instability at gastric pH levels.\n\n## Considerations and Warnings for Off-label Use and Dosing [9571.0 continued]\n- Rapamycin is not a cheap drug, with prices around $5 per milligram.\n- Caution advised against using compounded formulations from compounding pharmacies, due to variability in Purity and concentration.\n- The branded drug rapamune and generic serulimus are recommended over compounded versions.\n- A podcast is mentioned that covers the ins and outs of compounding pharmacies; not all are implausible, but due diligence is necessary.\n- Emphasized importance of ensuring rapamycin is in an enteric-coated capsule for proper bioavailability.\n\n## Effect of rapamycin on fertility [(02:49:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O67pvKxio10&t=10173s)\n- Research into the effects of rapamycin on ovarian aging and spermatogenesis is lacking due to limited funding, largely because it lacks a direct profit motive.\n- Studies have shown that in female mice, transient rapamycin treatment can delay or possibly reverse ovarian atrophy, restoring reproductive capacity to sterile mice.\n- Conversely, in male mice, rapamycin appears to impair spermatogenesis and potentially induce sterility.\n- The differential effects between male and female fertility might be due to the cell proliferation rates in spermatogenesis vs. oogenesis.\n- Spermatogenesis is a rapid proliferation process and is possibly more impacted by rapamycin due to its effects on cell growth, while oogenesis is a slower process.\n- Once male mice are taken off rapamycin, there might be a preservation of sperm quality, indicating that effects are dependent on dose and duration of treatment.\n- The role of rapamycin in anti-aging could be attributed to either a slowing of the cell cycle or true rejuvenation of cells.\n- There are indications from not yet published research that rapamycin may enable structural rejuvenation of atrophied ovaries in mice.\n- The potential to improve fertility outcomes by preserving or restoring Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels in women who have not reached the lowest AMH threshold is a topic of great interest.\n- Human clinical trials funded by smaller grants, such as one led by [Columbia's reproductive aging center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University), are exploring the safety and potential efficacy of rapamycin for ovarian function in women with premature ovarian failure in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVjKuH6OMo&t=0s)\n- [Dave Asprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Asprey) has changed his stance on softening truthful statements to avoid offending people.\n- He learned from [Joe Rogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan) to have integrity in his words and not worry about whether people like it or not.\n- [Asprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asprey) believes it's important to care about people enough to say the truth, even if it offends some.\n## 25% off Your First Order from SEED [(00:01:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVjKuH6OMo&t=100s)\n- Asprey recommends the probiotic supplement Seed.\n- He believes Seed is different from other probiotics and highly recommends it.\n- Asprey suggests trying Seed because it can make a noticeable difference in gut health within a few days.\n- A link for a 25% discount on Seed is provided in the description of the video.\n## Being Offended by the Truth [(00:02:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVjKuH6OMo&t=147s)\n- Dave [Asprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asprey) discusses the importance of not being easily offended and the need for individuals to take responsibility for their own emotional state.\n- He emphasizes that being triggered by certain information or opinions is a sign of a lack of self-control and that individuals need to work on their inner selves to become less susceptible to emotional manipulation.\n- Asprey encourages people to embrace diversity of thought and engage in conversations with individuals who hold different beliefs, as it leads to richer and more interesting interactions.\n- He suggests that people should not wait for disagreements to arise and instead proactively seek out uncomfortable conversations to foster personal growth.\n- Asprey highlights the value of using light-hearted humor to address sensitive topics, as it allows for the identification of individuals who are not open to building genuine relationships.\n## Sugar vs Omega-6s [(00:05:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVjKuH6OMo&t=357s)\n- Dave [Asprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asprey) believes that small amounts of fructose do not negatively impact him due to his metabolic health and close monitoring of body composition. He recommends limiting fructose to around 30 grams per day and avoiding processed sugar, especially compared to harmful oils like canola oil.\n- Asprey emphasizes that weight gain is not solely caused by sugar but also by the presence of bad oils and mitochondrial inhibitors in the diet, particularly omega-6 fats. He advises minimizing omega-6 intake, except for small amounts from avocados, occasional walnuts, and the 1.6% present in grass-fed beef.\n- Omega-6 fats not only cause inflammation but also inhibit cell membranes from expressing receptors properly, affecting insulin sensitivity and other cellular functions. Higher doses of omega-6 reduce mitochondrial efficiency, leading to impaired energy production and increased inflammation. They may also affect endocannabinoid receptors, contributing to overeating and cravings for processed foods.\n- While higher levels of omega-3s are generally beneficial, excessive consumption of [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid) and [DHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid) can lead to oxidation and systemic inflammation. A balanced approach is recommended, with adequate intake of DHA and EPA (around 2-4 grams per day) while minimizing both omega-6 and [omega-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid) intake.\n- Limiting oxidation is less important than reducing reactive oxygen species that are not produced through energy generation. High doses of omega-3s can have negative effects such as sagging skin and a sallow face. The optimal dose of omega-3s is not high, and some argue that it may even be zero.\n- Phosphorylated omega-3s are the best for the brain because they can enter it. Grill oil and sn2 fish oil are safer options for omega-3s compared to regular fish oil. High-quality krill oil is the safest choice for omega-3s.\n## Protein & Aging [(00:18:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVjKuH6OMo&t=1094s)\n- [Dave Asprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Asprey), an expert in longevity, has learned from experts in their 70s and 80s over the past 20 years.\n- Certain amino acids in animal meat, like methionine and tryptophan, can activate [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR), potentially increasing cancer risk and reducing lifespan.\n- Weightlifting suppresses mTOR, while carbs and sugar raise it.\n- Intermittent fasting, coffee, and weightlifting, followed by protein and carbs, effectively lower mTOR, leading to increased growth and muscle gain.\n- Protein is crucial for muscle growth, but exercise is more significant in preventing muscle loss.\n- Fasting can cause muscle loss, but its impact depends on the fast's length and individual factors.\n- Fasting should be adjusted based on one's state, gender, and stress levels, as excessive fasting can lead to negative effects from catabolic hormones.\n- Light and food are the primary signals for circadian timing, so bright lights in the morning and avoiding food after dark optimize circadian rhythms.\n- Dave Asprey's updated thoughts on intermittent fasting emphasize flexibility based on one's state and time of day, avoiding late meals to prevent sleep disruption, and using true darkness and avoiding food during the body's perceived nighttime to minimize jet lag.\n- For protein intake and longevity, consuming 1 gram of [animal protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanocobalamin) per pound of body weight is optimal, supplemented with collagen or glycine due to the importance of the methionine to glycine ratio.\n- Plant-based proteins are less effective than animal proteins and require double the intake due to lower absorption rates, making a vegan diet challenging for a longevity strategy.\n## Amount of Exercise for Longevity [(00:30:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVjKuH6OMo&t=1830s)\n- Dave [Asprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asprey) introduces the concept of \"slope of the curve biology,\" which suggests the body responds better to short, intense periods of stress followed by rest, rather than prolonged stress.\n- High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and AI-driven biohacking techniques can achieve significant fitness results in less time compared to traditional exercise routines.\n- Nutrient availability and adequate recovery are crucial for optimal adaptation and longevity.\n- The minimum effective dose of exercise should focus on quickly reaching and recovering from a stress state, rather than accumulating exercise time.\n- Fitness can be measured by the ability to adapt to physical demands, such as transitioning between flat and hilly terrain during running.\n- The body responds well to a quick lactate stimulus, suggesting chronic exposure to lactate may not be necessary.\n- Intense recovery methods like red light therapy and cryotherapy can accelerate the body's return to baseline after exercise.\n- For most deconditioned individuals, intense recovery is the fastest way to improve fitness, but professional athletes or those who exercise for enjoyment may have different training regimens.\n- Finding the minimum effective dose of exercise and recovery is important to avoid overtraining and burnout.\n## Where to Find More of Dave's Content [(00:38:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVjKuH6OMo&t=2314s)\n- Visit Dave's website: daveasp.com\n- Listen to his podcast: The Human Upgrade\n- Read his new book: Smarter Not Harder\n- Check out his new coffee company: Danger Coffee","## Introducing Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte of Altos Labs [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=0s)\n- Scientists believe they have discovered the [Fountain of Youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_Youth), which will likely be a major news story. [(00:00:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=2s)\n- This discovery stems from cell reprogramming methods based on Yamanaka factors, a technology that seems incredibly advanced.

[(00:02:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=131s)\n- Most age-related diseases are not caused by specific mutations but by a decrease in cellular resilience over time. [(00:03:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=223s)\n- Altering the epigenome, specifically the chromatin structure, can rejuvenate cells and potentially reverse disease. [(00:09:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=594s)\n- Delivering Yamanaka factors, which can reprogram cells, to specific unhealthy cells can increase lifespan and improve health without affecting healthy cells. [(00:20:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1201s)\n- This approach could potentially be used to rejuvenate organs for transplantation and treat a wide range of age-related diseases in humans. [(00:21:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1303s)\n\n## Chamath and Friedberg join Juan Carlos on stage to discuss the magnitude of his research [(00:22:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1368s)\n- Yamanaka factors are four proteins that can revert adult cells back into stem cells. [(00:24:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1452s)\n- Shortening exposure to Yamanaka factors allows cells to partially rejuvenate while maintaining their cell identity. [(00:26:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1589s)\n- Studies in mice and monkeys suggest that [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin), a drug used to treat diabetes, may have reprogramming capabilities that improve cognitive function and increase lifespan. [(00:31:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUjF3RG28SQ&t=1917s)","## Are Low Omega-3s Worse Than Smoking? [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=0s)\n- Low omega-3 levels (4% or less) have negative health effects comparable to smoking.\n- A high omega-3 index (8% or higher) can increase life expectancy by five years.\n- The average omega-3 index in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) is significantly lower than in [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), where people have a longer life expectancy.\n- Focusing on obtaining essential nutrients like omega-3s is more important for longevity than avoiding harmful substances like smoking.\n- Smoking increases the risk of heart disease more than cancer, even in small amounts.\n- Omega-3s protect against heart disease and lower inflammation, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n- Aiming for an omega-3 index of 8% or higher is optimal for health benefits.\n- Consuming 2 grams of omega-3 per day can effectively raise the omega-3 index from 4% to 8%.\n## How to Know What Omega-3 Supplements to Use [(00:07:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=451s)\n- When choosing an omega-3 supplement, look for third-party testing results to ensure the concentration of [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) and [DHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid) matches the label, and that the oxidation level is less than 10. Contaminants such as [PCBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl) and mercury should also be measured and kept to a minimum.\n- Triglyceride form is generally more bioavailable than ethyl ester form, but ethyl ester form should be taken with a meal, preferably a high-fat meal, to improve absorption.\n- Two grams of omega-3 per day can raise the omega-3 index from low to high, but the amount needed may vary depending on the form of omega-3 (triglyceride vs. ethyl ester).\n- Wild Alaskan salmon is a good source of omega-3s with low levels of contaminants, but the exact amount needed per week to meet omega-3 requirements is not specified.\n- It takes 120 days for red blood cells to turn over, so it's important to wait that long before testing Omega-3 levels after changing your diet.\n- Supplementing with a high-quality, low-oxidation triglyceride version of Omega-3s is recommended, along with having fish meals twice per week.\n## The UK Are Banning Disposable Vapes [(00:12:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=773s)\n- Disposable vapes' popularity among teenagers in schools raises concerns about nicotine dependency and health risks, especially with the introduction of fruity flavors.\n- While smoking rates have declined due to social stigma, countries like [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain), and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) in mainland Europe still have high smoking prevalence.\n- Nicotine products like mints, pouches, and Zyn gain popularity as focus enhancers, but concerns exist about their negative effects on gums and the safety of unknown flavorings.\n- The speaker expresses interest in exploring the potential benefits and risks of new technologies, including screens, virtual reality, health technologies, and novel delivery mechanisms.\n- Ketone IQ is a pre-workout supplement that provides clean energy, mental clarity, and quick delivery of ketones without fasting or carb restriction, backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee.\n## Discussing Forms of Intermittent Fasting [(00:20:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=1219s)\n- Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a form of intermittent fasting that involves extending the period of not eating.\n- There are circadian reasons to eat within a certain time window and have a period of rest and fasting.\n- Insulin sensitivity is highest in the morning and lowest in the evening, so blood glucose levels will be higher with the same carbohydrate intake in the evening.\n- Skipping breakfast as a way to do TRF is not ideal because it can lead to muscle atrophy, especially if not doing resistance training.\n- Resistance training can mitigate the muscle loss associated with TRF.\n- Time-restricted feeding (skipping breakfast) does not limit gains from resistance training if sufficient protein is consumed.\n- The recommended daily intake of protein is 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight to prevent muscle loss, and 1.6 grams per kilogram for physically active individuals.\n- Older adults are less sensitive to amino acids and require a higher protein intake of 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight to maintain muscle mass.\n## How to Incorporate Time-Restricted Eating Into Daily Life [(00:27:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=1644s)\n- Time-restricted eating, by stopping meals three hours before bed, can improve sleep quality and enter a fasted state five hours later.\n- Caloric restriction is crucial for weight loss, and obese or overweight individuals can fast without significant muscle loss if they engage in resistance training and consume sufficient protein.\n- Eggs are a good source of protein, lutein, and choline, and pasture-raised eggs contain more lutein.\n- Consuming protein prior to working out is important for muscle synthesis, and the recommended daily protein intake is 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight.\n- Intermittent fasting can be beneficial, but it's important to frontload protein earlier in the day to prevent muscle loss.\n- A balanced diet should include a variety of foods rich in essential micronutrients, particularly leafy greens like spinach, which are high in magnesium, calcium, vitamin K, and folate.\n- [Leafy greens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_vegetable), such as spinach, are often demonized for their oxalate content, but this is mostly unfounded, especially if you cook the greens or consume them with magnesium-rich foods.\n## How Important Are Leafy Greens? [(00:42:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=2527s)\n- Consume micronutrients like B vitamins, zinc, and iron from red meat, poultry, and grass-fed meat for a better omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid profile.\n- Manage calorie intake and expenditure to maintain energy balance and prevent weight gain.\n- Consider intermittent fasting as a natural way to restrict calorie intake and aid in weight management.\n- Prioritize whole foods, including both plants and meat, for optimal health and longevity.\n- Dr. Rhonda Patrick recommends a diverse, whole foods diet for overall well-being.\n- M-Ments offers NSF-certified supplements like FID doio grus and tonat Ali to increase testosterone levels and provides a rich source of Omega-3s.\n- M-Ments products come with a 30-day money-back guarantee, and you can use the code \"modern wisdom\" for a 20% discount at checkout.\n## The Biggest Movers for Cognitive Function [(00:48:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=2891s)\n- Regular vigorous exercise, such as high-intensity interval training or running, can improve cognitive function by increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor ([BDNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor)) and promoting neuroplasticity. It can also increase hippocampal volume, which is associated with learning and memory, and counteract age-related atrophy.\n- Micronutrient supplementation with a multivitamin containing magnesium, B vitamins, folate, and vitamin K can improve cognitive function in older adults and slow brain aging by about 2 years.\n- Blueberries, especially their anthocyanins, improve cognition, executive function, memory, processing speed, and motor coordination.\n- Dark chocolate, particularly cocoa polyphenols like kakin, can increase blood flow to the brain, improving cognition and executive function.\n- Lutein and zeaxanthin, found in egg yolks, kale, and other foods, are carotenoids that accumulate in the eyes and brain, protecting against macular degeneration and improving cognitive function.\n- Choline is important for brain function and fetal development.\n- Omega-3 fatty acids, especially in doses of 2 grams or more per day, improve cognitive function.\n- Anthocyanins and catechins found in blueberries, dark chocolate, and other foods have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that promote brain health.\n## What Actually is Brain Fog? [(01:00:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=3627s)\n- Brain fog, a reduction in mental clarity, can be caused by consuming high glycemic index foods, which lead to a high postprandial glucose response.\n- Avoiding refined carbohydrates and opting for low glycemic index foods, as well as engaging in exercise snacks like short bursts of intense exercise before or after a meal, can help reduce brain fog.\n- Consuming protein or fat 10 to 30 minutes before carbohydrates can slow down the postprandial glucose response and reduce brain fog.\n- Prioritizing protein during an eating window can help reduce carb intake and increase satiety.\n- Eating a high sugar and high-fat meal can cause a more significant inflammatory response, leading to sleepiness, mental fog, and disrupted neurotransmission in the brain.\n- Minimizing inflammation can be achieved by avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of unhealthy fats, as well as engaging in regular exercise, getting adequate sleep, and managing stress.\n- Consuming a high-fat diet without sufficient fiber or protein can lead to intestinal permeability and trigger an immune response, diverting energy from the brain to the immune system and causing inflammation.\n- Smaller meals and regular consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, such as one gram with each meal as recommended by Dr. Rhonda Patrick, can help reduce the postprandial inflammatory response and promote the production of specialized resolving molecules that help resolve inflammation.\n## The Keys to Improving Your Mood [(01:14:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=4448s)\n- Comfort eating high sugar foods after periods of low mood and inactivity can lead to inflammation, sleep disruption, and worsened mood.\n- Exercise is an effective way to improve mood and has comparable benefits to SSRI antidepressants.\n- Deliberate heat exposure, such as through sauna use, can be a non-pharmacological treatment to improve mood and reduce stress and anxiety.\n- Sauna use may be a more accessible and convenient option for individuals who find it challenging to engage in strenuous exercise.\n- High-intensity exercise improves mood by increasing oxygen and nutrients to the brain, releasing endorphins, and optimizing neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.\n- Sleep is important for mood regulation, but exercise may have a greater impact on overall health and longevity.\n- Regular sleep and wake patterns can significantly improve mood and overall well-being.\n- Time-restricted feeding may help mitigate the negative effects of shift work on metabolic outcomes.\n- Exercise is likely the most important factor in mitigating the negative effects of shift work on health.\n## An Ideal Cold & Heat Exposure Routine [(01:32:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=5552s)\n- Heat exposure, combined with exercise, can improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle gains, and sleep quality.\n- Regular sauna use, combined with exercise, is associated with a higher V2 Max compared to exercise alone.\n- Saunas have numerous health benefits, including reducing the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.\n- The optimal sauna temperature is around 174-175 degrees Fahrenheit, and the optimal duration is at least 20 minutes.\n- Infrared saunas require longer durations to achieve similar benefits.\n- Repeated sauna sessions with short breaks in between can lead to a significant increase in growth hormone levels.\n- Hot tubs and hot baths can also provide similar benefits to saunas, such as activating heat shock proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.\n- Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce muscle atrophy by 50% and should be taken four weeks in advance to be effective.\n## The Physiological Response to Cold Exposure [(01:49:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=6558s)\n- Cold exposure can improve mood, motivation, focus, and energy production by activating heat shock proteins and norepinephrine release, and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle tissue.\n- Cold exposure can optimize neurotransmitter function, improving focus, tension, mood, and anxiety.\n- For full benefits, including mitochondrial biogenesis and browning of fat, aim for 15 minutes at 50°F, or 3 to 3.5 minutes at 50°F followed by a gradual decrease in temperature.\n- Cold exposure should not be done within 5 hours of hypertrophy training or within a couple of hours of going to sleep.\n- Cold exposure can help brown fat, which is a therapeutic target for improving metabolic health and treating type 2 diabetes.\n- Cold exposure, particularly around the wrists and clavicle area, can stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and promote the browning of fat.\n## How to Design an Exercise Routine [(02:08:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=7705s)\n- Dr. Rhonda Patrick emphasizes the importance of consistent physical activity for overall health and longevity.\n- Vigorous intensity exercise, where the heart rate reaches 80% of the maximum heart rate, is more beneficial for non-athletes who engage in less than 10 hours of endurance training per week.\n- High-intensity interval training (HIIT) increases lactate production, which has positive effects on brain health, including increased neurotransmitters and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).\n- Lactate acts as an energy source for the brain during physical activity and promotes neuroplasticity, cognitive function, and neuroprotection.\n- High-intensity vigorous exercise may be more beneficial for overall health and longevity compared to moderate-intensity exercise like zone 2 training.\n- Regular exercise, including both zone 2 and high-intensity vigorous exercise, provides numerous benefits for physical and mental well-being.\n- High-intensity interval training (HIIT), such as the [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Cruise_Line) 4x4 protocol, can significantly improve [VO2 max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max) and overall fitness.\n- A two-year study involving untrained 50-year-olds showed that progressive maximal intensity exercise, combined with strength training and the Norwegian 4x4 protocol, led to improved cardiac structure and function, reduced cardiovascular disease risk, and enhanced exercise performance.\n- Resistance training combined with interval training is beneficial for heart health.\n## The Protocols to Improve VO2 Max [(02:23:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=8602s)\n- The Norwegian 4x4 protocol, which involves alternating four minutes of high-intensity exercise with three minutes of light recovery, repeated four times, is an effective method for improving V2 Max.\n- Vigorous exercise, such as running, cycling, and swimming, can also enhance V2 Max. Aim for 20 minutes of vigorous exercise at 75-80% of your maximum heart rate, with one to two sessions per week.\n- Regular exercise, even in short bursts, can significantly reduce cancer-related and cardiovascular-related mortality. Aim for 75-80% of your maximum heart rate for about 20 minutes daily.\n- High-intensity interval training (HIIT), with intervals of 30 seconds on and 15 seconds off, or 20 seconds on and 10 seconds off, can also be beneficial.\n- Even just 10 minutes of exercise daily can have positive effects on health and well-being, and the benefits extend to individuals who do not engage in regular leisure-time physical activity.\n## The Risks of Staying Sedentary [(02:30:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=9055s)\n- Sedentary behavior, such as sitting at a desk for extended periods, is an independent risk factor for diseases like cancer.\n- Even individuals who engage in regular exercise can still be considered sedentary if they spend a significant portion of their day sitting.\n- [Sedentarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle) can increase the risk of breast cancer in women, with a lifetime risk of one in eight.\n- Simple exercise snacks like bodyweight squats, high knees, chair squats, plank, and burpees can be incorporated throughout the day to break up sedentary time.\n- Exercise snacks can improve cognition, mood, and blood flow to the brain.\n- Exercise snacks are short bursts of physical activity that can be done throughout the day to break up sedentary time.\n- Examples of exercise snacks include bodyweight squats, high knees, chair squats, plank, and burpees.\n- Exercise snacks can be done at a desk or any convenient location.\n- Aim to do exercise snacks for 2-3 minutes every hour or two.\n- Exercise snacks can be timed around meals to manage the postprandial glucose response and improve cognitive function and mood.\n## Walking After a Meal [(02:34:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=9269s)\n- Post-meal vigorous intensity exercise, such as interval walking, is more effective in improving blood glucose levels compared to regular walking.\n- Building muscle mass through resistance training and adequate protein intake is essential for longevity, overall health, and preventing age-related muscle loss.\n- Resistance training should be incorporated into a weekly routine, with a minimum of two hours per week, focusing on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups.\n- Working with a coach can help prevent injuries and ensure proper form during resistance training.\n## At What Age Do You Stop Gaining Muscle Mass? [(02:40:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=9634s)\n- Muscle mass and strength decline with age, but resistance training can help counter this.\n- Lifting lighter weights with high volume and effort can be just as effective as lifting heavy weights for building muscle mass and strength.\n- The optimal rep range for hypertrophy is between 6 and 30 repetitions, with 1 to 3 reps in reserve.\n- Focus on tempo during weightlifting, with each rep lasting at least two seconds, especially during the eccentric (lowering) portion of the movement.\n- Incorporate exercises that stretch the muscles at the end range of motion.\n- Pause briefly at the bottom of each rep, especially during squats, to maximize muscle stretch and hypertrophy.\n- Train even when feeling tired, as physical activity can blunt the negative effects of sleep deprivation and reduce inflammation, leading to increased energy levels.\n- Exercise has anti-inflammatory effects that can counteract the stresses of daily life and improve overall well-being.\n- Adjust the intensity and duration of exercise when feeling tired to avoid injury and overexertion.\n## Refining the Story You Tell Yourself [(02:51:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvvw3jb6cs&t=10269s)\n- To boost confidence and reinforce a positive self-image, focus on overcoming challenges, even small ones, and tell yourself a positive story about your accomplishments.\n- For exercise, prioritize vigorous intensity, VO2 max training for brain benefits, and resistance training.\n- To check progress without formal testing, use a 12-minute run or walk test on a flat surface and calculate VO2 max using the covered distance.\n- The [Apple Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch) can estimate [VO2 max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max) but may not be accurate due to factors like running hills.\n- The Airbike is an effective machine for achieving a high heart rate and engaging both arms and legs.\n- Hybrid training, combining different types of exercise, is gaining popularity and may offer advantages in certain tests like the 12-minute run test.\n- Dr. Rhonda Patrick recommends using a stationary bike for the [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Cruise_Line) 4x4 Protocols to build VO2 Max.\n- Rhonda Patrick has a broad evidence base on fitness and health.\n- She created bdnfprotocol.com, a free guide with evidence-based protocols to maximize brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).\n- The guide includes exercise protocols, sauna protocols, and polyphenol consumption (e.g., blueberries).\n- Rhonda's personal protocol is also included in the guide.\n- [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) channel: Found My Fitness\n- Podcasts: interviews with experts and standalone videos discussing scientific topics (e.g., magnesium, vigorous exercise).\n- Podcast platforms: [Apple Podcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Podcasts),

Approaches\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) categorizes longevity approaches into four categories: essential behaviors, exogenous molecules, targeted disease processes, and a \"do everything\" approach.\n- Essential behaviors include eating, sleeping, and moving, which can be done in ways that promote or erode health.\n- Exogenous molecules are substances taken to impact these systems, such as caloric restriction, [rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus), and [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) precursors like NR and [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide).\n- Targeted disease processes focus on delaying the onset of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.\n- The \"do everything\" approach encompasses a wide range of interventions, including high doses of polyphenols, time-restricted feeding, red light therapy, and platelet-rich plasma.\n## Dr. Attia's Personal Supplement Regimen\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) takes several medications, including a [PCSK9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSK9) inhibitor, bidic acid, an [SGLT2 inhibitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGLT2_inhibitor), and rapamycin.\n- He believes that the SGLT2 inhibitor may also have geroprotective effects, citing the success of [canagliflozin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canagliflozin) in the Interventions Testing Program ([ITP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_thrombocytopenic_purpura)).\n- Dr. Attia takes 8mg of [rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) once a week, but has to take breaks due to side effects like mouth sores.\n- He views these side effects as a positive sign, indicating that the rapamycin is working as intended.\n- Dr. Attia takes [Huperzine A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huperzine_A) as a supplement, believing it may improve cognitive function, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). He acknowledges that the evidence is not overwhelming but considers the potential benefits to outweigh the risks.\n- He also takes vitamin D despite spending time outdoors, as his levels remain surprisingly low. He takes 5,000 IU daily, raising his levels from around 30 to 50. He acknowledges the ongoing debate about optimal vitamin D levels.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) takes methyl folate and methyl B12 to lower homocysteine levels. He explains that elevated homocysteine is associated with negative health outcomes, potentially impacting vascular health through its effect on nitric oxide synthesis. He believes that lowering homocysteine may improve vascular health.\n- He avoids supplementing with vitamin B6 due to concerns about potential nerve damage.\n- Dr. Attia takes magnesium in three forms: magnesium L-threonate, magnesium glycinate, and magnesium oxide. He believes magnesium is crucial for bowel function and muscle health, citing his lack of cramps despite intense exercise.\n- He takes electrolytes through the company Element, in which he is an investor.\n- He also takes creatine monohydrate, AG1, and Pendulum probiotic. He believes Pendulum is the only probiotic with a meaningful effect on the body due to its anaerobic bacteria content.\n- Dr. Attia takes three products from Pendulum: Glucose Control, [Polyphenol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenol), and Acromania. He explains that Pendulum is a unique supplement company that adheres to pharmaceutical [GMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_manufacturing_practice) conditions due to the anaerobic bacteria they produce.\n- He also takes AG1, a daily multivitamin and adaptogen blend, to supplement his diet and support gut health.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) emphasizes the importance of quality fish oil, aiming for over 1 gram of [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) per day, and takes a high dose of vitamin D3, adjusting the dosage based on blood tests.\n- He also takes methyl B12, [Tongkat Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurycoma_longifolia) for testosterone optimization, and green tea capsules for a stimulatory effect.\n- Dr. Attia uses [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) and NR in powder form for their potential benefits, and utilizes Element MH as an electrolyte supplement.\n- He takes 10 grams of creatine monohydrate daily for muscle health and cognitive function.\n- Dr. Attia previously experimented with nicotine gum but stopped due to its stimulating effects and potential for dependence.\n- Before sleep, he takes magnesium 3 and 8, apigenin, and theanine for relaxation and sleep quality.\n- He uses a high-quality whey protein as a protein replacement and has experimented with other supplements like [Shilajit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilajit), but has not found consistent long-term benefits.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) is interested in supplements that provide sustained energy without caffeine and uses yerba mate and coffee for his caffeine intake.\n- Dr. Attia's supplement regimen includes caffeine in tablet form, alpha-GPC, and garlic.\n- He emphasizes that behavioral factors like sleep, exercise, nutrition, and sunlight have a much greater impact on healthspan and lifespan than any single supplement.\n- He views supplements as an insurance policy or an augmentation to mental and physical health, but not as essential.\n## NAD and Longevity\n- The episode focuses on the [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) pathway, a potential target for improving lifespan, and explores various molecules and approaches to increasing NAD levels.\n- The discussion includes a comparison of NR, [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide), direct infusions, and oral NAD in terms of their ability to enter cells and their potential efficacy for longevity and healthspan.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) discusses NAD and longevity, focusing on four categories of approaches to living longer.\n- The first category is \"dos and don'ts,\" which includes getting enough exercise, eating right, and understanding your genetics.\n- The second category is \"calories, glucose, insulin, etc.,\" which all relate to [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) (mammalian Target of [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus)), a molecule that plays a crucial role in cell growth and development.\n- Dr. Attia argues that the period from infancy to puberty is one of the most rapid phases of aging, as evidenced by the significant physical changes that occur during this time.\n- He uses his daughter's annual birthday photos as an example, highlighting the dramatic changes in her appearance and size during her first ten years of life.\n- Dr. Attia categorizes interventions for longevity into three main categories: behaviors, disease-targeting molecules, and geroprotective molecules.\n- Behaviors encompass lifestyle choices that promote health and longevity, such as diet, exercise, and sleep.\n- Disease-targeting molecules are medications that directly address specific diseases, such as Metformin for diabetes, [SGLT2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGLT2_inhibitor) inhibitors for heart disease, and [PCSK9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSK9) inhibitors for high cholesterol.\n- Geroprotective molecules target the fundamental processes of aging, aiming to slow down the aging process itself.\n- [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) is an example of a geroprotective molecule that targets a specific hallmark of aging, [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) signaling.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) discusses the potential of activating sirtuins for longevity.\n- He mentions that overexpressing sirtuins in yeast has been shown to increase lifespan in some strains, but this finding is not consistent across all strains.\n- The speaker then explores whether this effect translates to other species, such as flies, worms, and mammals.\n- He notes that there is one transgenic mouse experiment where overexpressing [SIRT6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin_6) resulted in a 10-15% increase in lifespan for male mice, but not for female mice.\n- The speaker clarifies that a transgenic mouse is one that has been genetically modified to express a specific gene, in this case, SIRT6, at higher levels than normal.\n- He emphasizes that this is just one study and that more research is needed to confirm the effects of SIRT6 overexpression on lifespan in mammals.\n- The speaker concludes by stating that there is evidence suggesting that overexpressing sirtuins in yeast and in one transgenic mouse model can increase lifespan, but further research is necessary to understand the mechanisms involved and to determine if these findings can be translated to humans.\n- Ceru activators are believed to improve mitochondrial biogenesis, increase DNA repair, and reduce the soluble products of senescent cells (SASP). These are all beneficial effects for longevity.\n- DNA repair is a crucial aspect of aging, as DNA damage accumulates over time. This damage can lead to cancer and other age-related diseases.\n- The relationship between DNA damage and aging is complex. It is not simply a matter of more mutations occurring with age. The immune system's ability to detect and repair damage also plays a role.\n- [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) is a key substrate for DNA repair. As we age, NAD levels decline, potentially contributing to reduced DNA repair capacity.\n- Ceru activators may help to increase NAD levels. This could be a mechanism by which they promote DNA repair and longevity.\n- The most famous ceru activator is [resveratrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol). It is considered the \"heavyweight champion\" of ceru activators.\n- Resveratrol, a compound found in grapes, gained popularity about 20 years ago due to a single study suggesting it increased lifespan in mice.\n- The study's authors claimed Resveratrol activated sirtuins, which are proteins linked to improved mitochondrial function, reduced inflammation, and enhanced DNA repair.\n- However, numerous subsequent studies failed to replicate these findings, except for one experiment using a specific mouse model with severe fatty liver disease.\n- In this particular model, Resveratrol seemed to improve survival by preventing the fatty liver from encroaching on the chest cavity and hindering breathing.\n- Despite this outlier, the Intervention Testing Program ([ITP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_thrombocytopenic_purpura)), a rigorous scientific program funded by the [National Institutes of Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health), found no evidence that Resveratrol extended lifespan in mice.\n- The ITP conducted its experiments in triplicate across three independent labs, using the same dosage and methodology as the original study.\n- The ITP's findings suggest that [Resveratrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol), while potentially beneficial in specific circumstances, does not have a significant impact on lifespan in general.\n- The discussion revolves around the role of NAD and [NADH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) in the aging process and their potential as longevity supplements.\n- NAD levels decline with age, particularly in the skin, while NADH levels increase.\n- NAD is crucial for energy production in the mitochondria, where it facilitates the transfer of chemical energy from food to electrical energy.\n- NADH is the electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, which is a key process in energy production.\n- The text highlights the importance of NAD and NADH in maintaining life, as they are essential for converting chemical energy from food into [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate), the energy currency of the body.\n- NAD levels decline with age, but the total amount of NAD and NADH remains the same.\n- The decline in [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels is actually a reduction in redox potential, which is the ability of NAD to convert chemical energy into electrical energy.\n- This reduction in redox potential is likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a common consequence of aging.\n- Red light and near-infrared light therapy has shown promise in improving mitochondrial function in the eye, potentially by reducing reactive oxygen species.\n- While NAD supplementation is a popular approach to combat aging, the relationship between NAD levels and aging is complex and not fully understood.\n- The pathway leading to NAD involves NR, [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide), and NAD, with each molecule being a precursor to the next.\n- There is currently no definitive evidence that increasing NAD levels through supplementation can slow down aging.\n- The discussion about [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) supplementation is still in its early stages, and more research is needed to determine its efficacy and safety.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) emphasizes the importance of critical thinking when it comes to supplements, particularly those marketed for longevity. He argues that many supplements lack scientific justification and are based on leaps of faith.\n- He acknowledges taking NMN and NR himself, but emphasizes that his personal experience is anecdotal and doesn't necessarily translate to scientific evidence.\n- Dr. Attia highlights the lack of evidence supporting the idea that raising NAD levels will directly improve healthspan or lifespan. He points out that while NAD levels decline with age, there's no proof that increasing them will correct any underlying problems.\n- He discusses the various methods of supplementing NAD, including intravenous administration and oral intake of precursors like NR and [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide). He believes there's little difference in their effectiveness, as they all ultimately increase NAD levels in the blood.\n- Dr. Attia shares his personal experience with intravenous NAD, describing the uncomfortable side effects he experienced, including chest pressure, leg cramps, and nausea. He criticizes the tendency to equate unpleasant sensations with effectiveness, arguing that discomfort doesn't necessarily indicate a positive physiological effect.\n- Dr. Attia has tried both [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) infusions and sublingual NMN. He found that both methods made him feel better, but it's difficult to determine if this is due to a placebo effect or the actual effects of the substances.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) prefers sublingual NMN because it is more cost-effective than NR. He takes 1.5 grams of NMN daily and has noticed increased energy, faster hair and nail growth, and a laxative effect.\n- Dr. Attia acknowledges that there is more scientific evidence supporting NR as a more effective precursor to NAD than orally ingested NMN. However, he believes that the cost difference makes NMN a more practical option.\n- Dr. Attia suggests that a study comparing the effects of oral NR and sublingual NMN on NAD blood levels would be valuable.\n- Dr. Attia notes that NAD infusions are expensive and the benefits are unclear. He emphasizes the need for rigorous testing to determine the efficacy of these interventions.\n- Dr. Attia mentions the Interventions Testing Program ([ITP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_thrombocytopenic_purpura)) as a valuable tool for testing the efficacy of various molecules. He encourages listeners to refer to his previous discussions with Rich Miller for more detailed information on the ITP.\n- The Interventions Testing Program (ITP) is a rigorous program that tests the effects of various molecules on lifespan in non-inbred mice.\n- The ITP has tested over 50 molecules, and only a few have shown to extend lifespan.\n- Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) was tested at a high dose (500-1000 mg/kg) but did not extend lifespan, improve healthspan, or show any significant changes compared to a placebo.\n- [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) (Rapa) has been shown to extend lifespan in mice, even when administered late in life.\n- [Canagliflozin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canagliflozin), an [SGLT2 inhibitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGLT2_inhibitor), and acarbose, a drug that inhibits glucose absorption, both extended lifespan in mice without causing weight loss. This suggests that tight glycemic control, independent of weight, may be a longevity benefit.\n- 17α-estradiol extended lifespan in male mice, highlighting the potential sex-specific effects of certain interventions.\n- A study involving NR and a product called Tertill Bean, believed to be a ceramide activator, was conducted on humans with fatty liver disease.\n- The study, involving approximately 100 participants, found no significant improvement in hepatic fat index, a measure of fatty liver disease, in those taking NR and Tertill Bean compared to those taking a placebo.\n- The study on NR (nicotinamide riboside) found no significant difference in hepatic fat, body weight, inflammatory markers, glycemic markers, or liver function tests between the high-dose and low-dose groups.\n- A subanalysis, which is not a primary outcome, showed a statistically significant reduction in liver fat in the low-dose group for individuals with a hepatic fat score below 27%. However, this finding may not be clinically significant.\n- The study on NMN ([nicotinamide mononucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide)) found a statistically significant increase in glucose disposal with insulin infusion in the NMN group compared to the placebo group. However, this increase was very small and considered clinically insignificant.\n- The speaker emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between statistical significance and clinical significance, noting that a statistically significant result may not necessarily translate to a meaningful improvement in health outcomes.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) and Andrew discuss the debate surrounding NMN and NR supplements, noting that the [FDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) has not authorized NMN for sale as a supplement, while NR is considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS).\n- Dr. Attia believes the debate is primarily commercial, with little scientific basis for favoring one over the other.\n- While acknowledging some studies showing minor benefits, Dr. Attia considers them insignificant and clinically irrelevant.\n- The only study he found with a potential signal involved a reduction in basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas (skin cancers) by 60-80% in individuals taking either NMN or NR.\n- Dr. Attia emphasizes that this study needs to be replicated, but if confirmed, it could justify taking these supplements for individuals at high risk of these skin cancers, particularly those with sun-sensitive skin or occupations involving prolonged sun exposure.\n- Dr. Attia discusses a study on a type of skin cancer that showed a significant reduction in [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels in the skin. He wonders if this could explain why there is a potential benefit to NR and [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) supplementation for skin health.\n- He acknowledges that NAD infusions are expensive and may not be the most effective way to increase NAD levels.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) suggests that spending time exercising and eating healthy food could be a more beneficial and cost-effective way to improve health than NAD infusions.\n- He mentions that research has shown that exercise, particularly resistance training, can enhance the rewarding properties of food, making it taste better.\n- Dr. Attia discusses the similarities and differences between NR and NMN, noting that NR is more readily taken up by cells and converted to NAD.\n- He cites research by Josh Rabinowitz, who has shown that the liver is likely the primary site of NAD uptake, followed by blood.\n- Dr. Attia mentions that some companies claim NR is 25% more effective than [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) at raising blood [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels, but he emphasizes that this claim is based on milligram-for-milligram comparisons and that the impact on cellular NAD levels is unclear.\n- He expresses trust in Josh Rabinowitz's research on NAD flux, as Rabinowitz has no financial stake in the supplement industry.\n- The speaker expresses uncertainty about the effectiveness of NMN and NR supplements, questioning whether they actually increase intracellular NAD levels significantly.\n- He argues that even if they do increase NAD levels, it's unclear whether this has a meaningful impact on lifespan or healthspan.\n- The speaker criticizes the marketing of these supplements, suggesting that they are often promoted with exaggerated claims about their benefits.\n- He highlights the difficulty of conducting longevity experiments in humans, making it challenging to definitively prove the efficacy of these supplements.\n- The speaker mentions the FDA's recent decision to classify [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) as a drug due to ongoing clinical trials, which effectively prohibits its sale as a supplement.\n- He compares this situation to the previous case of [N-acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) (NAC), which was also reclassified as a drug, potentially due to lobbying efforts from pharmaceutical companies.\n- The speaker suggests that the strongest argument for taking NMN might be its potential to reduce the risk of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, but emphasizes that this needs further research.\n- He concludes by questioning the need for clinical trials on supplements that are marketed without specific health claims, arguing that rigorous testing is necessary for drugs but not for supplements.\n- There have been concerns about NR (nicotinamide riboside) potentially increasing cancer risk, but experts like [Charles Brenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Brenner_(biochemist)) have argued that the studies supporting this claim were not well-conducted.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) acknowledges that the field of longevity research lacks the rigor found in pharmacotherapy, and he believes Charles Brenner does good work in this area.\n- Dr. Attia doesn't believe Charles Brenner would argue that NR increases lifespan, but rather that it may have positive effects on [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels, leading to anti-inflammatory benefits.\n- Dr. Attia agrees with the notion that there's no logical connection between caloric restriction and NR, calling it a \"shell game.\"\n- Dr. Attia believes there's better research on [rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) because there's no commercial interest in the drug itself, as it's off-patent and inexpensive.\n- While rapamycin is not cheap, it's significantly less expensive than some other medications.\n- The commercial interest lies in rapalogs, which are analogs of rapamycin being investigated for new indications, particularly in immune function.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) highlights a 2014 study by Joan Mannick and Lloyd Klickstein using everolimus, a rapalog, which showed enhanced immunity in response to an influenza vaccine in 65-year-olds.\n- This study was a turning point for Dr. Attia, shifting his perspective on rapamycin from a curiosity to a potential therapeutic agent.\n- The study demonstrated that intermittent dosing of rapamycin can improve immune function, suggesting it's an immune modulator.\n- Dr. Attia believes future research should focus on developing drugs that are more specific to [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) complex 1, which [rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) is not, but intermittent dosing can mitigate this issue.\n- He emphasizes the need for research on rapamycin's efficacy in areas other than longevity, as lifespan cannot be tested in humans.\n## The Importance of \"Vigor\" and \"Well-being\"\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) questions the value of biological aging tests, citing his own experience with a movement test that showed him to be 20 years old in terms of movement ability. He believes that such tests are unreliable and that chronological age is a better predictor of remaining lifespan.\n- Dr. Attia acknowledges that he is 49 years old and that, based on actuarial tables, his life expectancy would be around 37 more years.\n- Dr. Attia shares that he has a chart that tracks his lifespan in weeks and his subjective level of vigor, which he rates on a scale of 0 to 10.\n- Dr. Attia explains that his vigor was lower in his 20s and 30s due to excessive work hours and poor lifestyle choices. He has seen an increase in vigor since his 40s and now tracks it every two months, adjusting for stressors and positive life events.\n- Dr. Attia's goal is to identify the behavioral factors that contribute to his vigor and longevity.\n- Dr. Attia emphasizes the importance of maintaining \"vigor\" and \"well-being\" as we age, acknowledging that achieving this may require more effort in later years.\n- He highlights the value of visualizing our lifespan through a chart, as it helps us grasp the reality of our mortality, something our brains often try to avoid.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) discusses the concept of \"actuarial age\" versus \"biological age,\" using the example of a 49-year-old male with a predicted lifespan of 88-91 years.\n- He questions the reliability of biological age tests, arguing that a younger biological age doesn't necessarily translate to a longer lifespan.\n- He points out that biological age measurements are often noisy and influenced by various factors, making it difficult to interpret their significance.\n- Dr. Attia uses the example of triglyceride levels to illustrate the variability of biological measurements, emphasizing the need for standardization and context.\n- He concludes by expressing skepticism about the reliability of biological age tests, suggesting that they may not be as precise or meaningful as they seem.\n- Dr. Attia discusses the difficulty of accurately sequencing the epigenome, highlighting that companies currently offering epigenetic testing may not be providing truly accurate data.\n- He compares the radiation exposure from airport scanners and flights to other sources like CT scans and living at higher altitudes, emphasizing that the amount of radiation received from these sources is relatively low compared to the recommended annual limit.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) mentions that people working in nuclear plants, who receive significantly higher radiation exposure, do not seem to have an increased risk of cancer, suggesting that the concern about radiation from everyday sources might be overblown.\n- He believes that the work we do in our 50s and 60s is crucial for setting the stage for maintaining vitality in our later years, emphasizing the importance of building a strong foundation for longevity.\n- The period between 50s and 70s is crucial for longevity because aging starts to become more apparent during this time.\n- Dr. Attia and the speaker acknowledge that they are not as resilient as they used to be, and they need to prioritize self-care, including sleep, diet, and recovery from workouts.\n- The goal during this period is to build up as much physiological reserve as possible, as compounding effects of healthy habits make a significant difference.\n- It is still possible to gain muscle mass in your 50s and 60s, but it becomes increasingly difficult in your 70s.\n- Power declines faster than strength, and muscle mass declines even slower.\n- Maintaining muscle mass is important because it acts as a glucose sink and contributes to overall health.\n- It is crucial to avoid injuries during this period, as recovery becomes more challenging with age.\n- The decline in energy levels with age is a common observation, but the exact reasons are not fully understood.\n- Ben Baris, a friend of Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) and the speaker, used to ask about the decline in energy levels as he aged.\n- The speaker acknowledges that the decline in energy levels is a complex issue and there is no definitive answer.\n- Dr. Attia observes that children, especially young boys, have an abundance of spontaneous energy, which he describes as \"kinetic desire.\" He notes that this energy level significantly decreases as children transition into teenagers.\n- Dr. Attia wonders if [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) supplementation could be a factor in maintaining energy levels, but he acknowledges that while he takes [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) and NR, he hasn't experienced a significant boost in energy that would allow him to replicate the spontaneous energy of children.\n- He emphasizes that good sleep, exercise, and nutrition are crucial for energy levels and vitality, but acknowledges that these are challenging to prioritize for adults with busy lives.\n- Dr. Attia shares his personal preference for healthy food and his belief that exercise, particularly when completed before 9:00 a.m., can increase energy levels throughout the day. He suggests that this could be a factor in promoting both healthspan and lifespan.\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) believes that the timing of exercise can significantly impact energy levels throughout the day. He hypothesizes that this is related to the change in body temperature that occurs during exercise and throughout the day.\n- He suggests that exercising early in the morning, after the lowest temperature phase of the circadian rhythm, can lead to increased energy levels throughout the day.\n- Dr. Attia notes that many high-achieving individuals, including Joo Wilink, Eddie Chang, and [Stanford School of Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_School_of_Medicine) administrators, are early morning exercisers.\n- He acknowledges that there could be a reverse causality, where high-energy individuals are more likely to exercise early in the morning.\n- Dr. Attia shares his own experience with early morning exercise, noting that it has a significant impact on his energy levels.\n- He encourages people to experiment with the timing of their workouts to find what works best for them.\n## The Hubman Lab\n- Dr. [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) encourages viewers to subscribe to the Hubman Lab [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube) channel, podcast, and newsletter.\n- He also encourages viewers to leave reviews and engage with him on social media platforms.\n- The Hubman Lab newsletter offers free protocols on various topics, including neuroplasticity, sleep optimization, dopamine regulation, and fitness.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=0s)\n- The speaker discusses a protein called \"fist Statin\" which is found in high doses in eggs.\n- This protein can help inhibit and suppress myostatin activity, which in turn helps build muscle.\n- The speaker suggests that eggs are a cornerstone of good nutrition.\n- The speaker introduces Dr. Bob Hariri as an expert in longevity and regenerative medicine.\n- The speaker asks Dr. Hariri to identify the four pillars of longevity.\n\n## 25% off Your First Order from SEED [(00:00:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=32s)\n- The speaker recommends a product called [Seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed) Daily Symbiotic, which is a prebiotic and probiotic.\n- The speaker states that the product is 25% off and provides a link to purchase it.\n- The speaker emphasizes the importance of gut health in relation to diet and weight loss.\n- The speaker highlights Seed's commitment to research and clinical trials.\n- The speaker states that Seed is the only probiotic they have ever recommended on their channel.\n\n## Dr. Hariri's 4 Pillars of Longevity [(00:01:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=91s)\n- Maintaining a high level of performance across various bodily systems is crucial for longevity and quality of life as we age.\n- These systems include mobility, cognition, immunity, and aesthetics.\n- High performance mobility relies on healthy muscle tissue and joints, while high performance cognition ensures effective brain function and interaction with the environment.\n- A strong immune system is essential for protection against threats and recovery processes, contributing to overall health.\n- Youthful aesthetics play a role in maintaining a sense of well-being and social engagement, impacting quality of life and self-perception.\n\n## High-Performance Mobility & Muscle Mass [(00:02:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=160s)\n- Maintaining high-performance mobility and muscle mass is crucial for longevity. This is because muscle plays a significant role in overall health, beyond just force generation.\n- Muscle is a major metabolic driver, accounting for 50% of the average person's wet body mass. It is a highly active organ that produces proteins, peptides, and factors that influence brain, cardiac, and immune function.\n- Muscle mass is a key factor in longevity, as it helps maintain a synthetic apparatus that supports overall health. Studies have shown that maintaining muscle mass and strength, even in individuals who are technically obese, significantly reduces the risk of dying from cancer or heart disease.\n- Muscle mass contributes to cardiac function by increasing blood flow and calorie expenditure during movement. Even at rest, muscle burns a significant amount of calories, making it a vital component of overall metabolic health.\n\n## Myostatin, Follistatin & Stem Cells [(00:06:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=391s)\n- Myostatin is a protein that limits muscle growth. Blocking myostatin allows for unchecked muscle growth, as seen in Belgian Blue bulls. Myostatin is naturally counteracted by [follistatin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follistatin), a protein found in high concentrations in eggs.\n- Follistatin can be used to inhibit myostatin activity and promote muscle growth. While there are synthetic myostatin inhibitors, they can have irreversible side effects. Follistatin, as a dietary component, offers a safer alternative.\n- Muscle tissue plays a crucial role in blood circulation. Muscle contractions act as an auxiliary pump, supporting the heart and improving blood flow, especially in the lower extremities.\n- Muscle tissue is also a major reservoir for stem cells and immune cells. These cells reside in the walls of blood vessels within muscle tissue, ready to be mobilized in response to signals like inflammation or metabolic stress.\n- Healthy muscle tissue provides a larger reservoir for stem cells, potentially enhancing the body's ability to repair and recover from injuries and age-related decline. This is supported by anecdotal evidence suggesting that individuals with more muscle mass may experience faster recovery from injuries.\n- Mobility is crucial for circulating stem cells and promoting recovery. Modern medical practices emphasize early mobilization after surgeries and injuries, recognizing the importance of stem cell availability for repair.\n\n## High-Performance Cognition [(00:15:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=926s)\n- Cognitive performance is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of longevity. The text highlights a growing interest in cognitive health and performance, with individuals seeking ways to enhance brain function beyond physical fitness.\n- Metabolic health plays a significant role in cognitive function. The text emphasizes the importance of a healthy metabolic environment for optimal brain function. Factors like oxygen levels, ketone utilization, and glucose metabolism all impact cognitive performance.\n- Exercise, particularly high-intensity exercise, can improve cognitive function. The text discusses research showing that even under conditions of high metabolic stress, such as those experienced by special forces operatives, cognitive performance can improve. This is attributed to increased blood flow, oxygen delivery, and potential shifts towards ketosis.\n- Metabolic flexibility, achieved through proper training and nutrition, can enhance cognitive function. The text suggests that by improving the body's ability to utilize fat as fuel, glucose can be spared for the brain, leading to better cognitive performance. This concept is illustrated by the example of special forces operators who, through training, become more efficient at fat utilization, potentially sparing glucose for brain function.\n- The brain is part of a larger metabolic system. The text emphasizes that the brain's metabolic needs are influenced by the overall metabolic state of the body. By optimizing the body's metabolic function, we can create conditions that support optimal brain function.\n\n## Inflammation & Senescent Cells [(00:28:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=1686s)\n- Inflammation is a key driver of aging. It is a continuous process that can be slowed down by adopting anti-inflammatory strategies.\n- [Inflammaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammaging) is a term used to describe the chronic inflammatory process associated with aging. It is caused by an imbalance between demolition and repair processes within the body.\n- Senescent cells are cells that have lost their ability to divide and contribute to inflammation. They are a target for therapies aimed at slowing down aging.\n- Natural killer cells are responsible for clearing senescent cells. However, their effectiveness declines with age, leading to an accumulation of senescent cells.\n- Senolytics are substances that can kill and clear senescent cells. They are crucial for maintaining tissue and organ quality.\n- Autophagy is a process that removes damaged cells and cellular components. It can be induced by fasting, exercise, and other methods.\n- Autophagy is essential for healthy tissue repair and renewal. It is analogous to pruning in plants, which removes dead wood and promotes growth.\n- Effective senolytics and a healthy population of stem cells are essential for healthy aging. Senolytics clear senescent cells, while stem cells replace them with healthy cells.\n- Fasting and exercise are both effective ways to induce autophagy. However, the degree of autophagy induced by each method varies depending on the duration and intensity.\n- Eliminating threats to longevity, such as infectious diseases and environmental toxins, can contribute to increased lifespan. This is analogous to the elimination of threats like saber-tooth tigers in the past.\n\n## Youthful Aesthetics [(00:37:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=2264s)\n- Youthful Aesthetics and Mental Health: Maintaining a youthful appearance can have a positive impact on mental health, leading to improved self-image and a more positive outlook. This, in turn, can boost confidence, motivation, and overall well-being.\n- The Link Between Aesthetics and Longevity: The speaker suggests that a positive self-image, often linked to youthful aesthetics, can contribute to a longer lifespan. This is because a positive mental state can positively affect the immune system, exercise tolerance, and cognitive performance.\n- The Importance of Personal Goals: The speaker emphasizes that personal improvement, particularly in fitness, should be driven by individual goals and self-perception rather than external validation. Focusing on personal standards and achieving them can be a powerful motivator.\n\n## Where to Find More of Dr. Hariri's Content [(00:47:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY36GKQQ9p8&t=2830s)\n- The speaker's blog can be found at pilotinghealth.com.\n- The speaker's social media accounts can be found under the username DrBobHariri.\n- The speaker's therapeutics company, Cellularity, can be found at clriTy.com.\n- The speaker's clinic system, Fountain Life, can be found at FountainLife.com.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=0s)\n- Biological age is how old we are biologically, compared to our chronological age.\n- Biomarkers, telomere length, and glycan age tests can be used to determine biological age.\n- Some people are biologically older or younger than their chronological age.\n- The goal is to reduce biological age and reverse the aging process.\n## 15% off Bon Charge's PEMF Mat [(00:01:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=91s)\n- [PEMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_electromagnetic_field_therapy) (pulse electromagnetic field) mat from Bond Charge uses grounding technology and different waves to change body state and promote relaxation.\n- The mat combines [red light therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_laser_therapy), infrared heat, and PEMF settings to provide various benefits.\n- Using the mat for 10-15 minutes daily during meditation or breathwork can enhance relaxation and overall well-being.\n- Worldwide shipping is available, and a discount link is provided for savings.\n## Get Some Data [(00:03:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=189s)\n- Get health data to understand your current health status.\n- Health insurance can cover basic tests like CBC, CMP, lipid panel, hormone panel, and nutrient deficiency tests.\n- Early detection of conditions like pre-diabetes and hypertension is crucial.\n## Keep Small Promises to Yourself [(00:05:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=342s)\n- Make small promises to yourself and keep them consistently.\n- This teaches discipline and shows that discipline is more important than motivation.\n- Breaking small promises leads to breaking larger promises and internal dishonesty.\n## Develop a Morning Routine (morning routine tips) [(00:06:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=413s)\n- Develop a consistent morning routine that includes grounding, breathwork, and light exposure to improve overall health and well-being.\n- Grounding involves taking off your shoes and touching the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s surface to discharge built-up charge.\n- Breathwork, such as the WHM style, can improve oxygenation, reset the circadian clock, and promote overall well-being.\n- Early morning sunlight exposure is crucial for regulating various biological processes.\n- Prioritize intense exercise to strengthen auxiliary muscles of respiration and improve oxygen intake.\n- Cold showers provide long-term benefits by releasing cold shock proteins, cerin survival genes, and boosting metabolism and mood.\n- For those willing to invest, a [genetic methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation) test can provide valuable insights for personalized health strategies.\n## Genetic Methylation [(00:13:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=809s)\n- Methylation is a process in the human body that converts nutrients into a usable form.\n- A methylation test can identify genetic variations and determine nutrient deficiencies.\n- Genetic methylation testing can reveal specific nutrient deficiencies that can be addressed through targeted supplementation, improving health outcomes.\n- High homocysteine levels due to genetic mutations can lead to hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathies, and ocular nerve damage.\n- [Genetic methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation) tests provide personalized supplement recommendations based on an individual's unique genetic profile.\n- Light devices, especially those emitting blue spectrum light, can mimic sunlight and improve health.\n- The first 45 minutes of morning sunlight provide healthy blue light.\n## Photobiomodulation [(00:19:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=1145s)\n- [Red light therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_laser_therapy) (photobiomodulation) improves collagen, elastin, fibrin, microvascular circulation, and reduces inflammation. It also benefits the eyes and carries minimal risk.\n- Near-infrared and far-infrared light have different mechanisms of action compared to red light.\n- Whole-body photobiomodulation is more effective than home devices due to the proximity of the light source to the skin.\n- Pulse electromagnetic field ([PEMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsed_electromagnetic_field_therapy)) mats emit low-level magnetic currents that improve blood flow and cellular function by separating clumped red blood cells.\n- Red [light therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy) dissociates mitochondrial nitric oxide, increasing oxygen docking and cellular energy production. Its effects can be measured using nitric oxide saliva strips and lactate meters.\n- Red light therapy lowers lactate levels, enabling rapid recovery after exercise and enhancing athletic performance.\n- [Red light therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_laser_therapy) offers numerous benefits, including reducing inflammation, improving mitochondrial oxygen use, and increasing collagen, elastin, and fibrin production. It is considered one of the best biohacking devices for longevity.\n- Red light therapy devices can be costly, but smaller, portable options are available for around $1,000.\n- Using red light therapy upon waking and during sunrise and sunset can help reset the circadian rhythm.\n- Targeted supplementation can also contribute to longevity and falls within a $1,000 budget.\n## Targeted Supplementation [(00:33:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=1995s)\n- Targeted supplementation, especially [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D) with K2 (MK7), is essential for calcium transport, immunity, fertility, and overall health.\n- Methylated [multivitamins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivitamin), tailored to individual needs through genetic testing, can significantly improve anxiety, sleep quality, cognitive function, and energy levels within days.\n- Blood tests and [genetic methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation) tests can identify deficiencies and guide personalized supplementation.\n- Methylated nutrients have been shown to improve blood biomarkers, including thyroid hormone levels, homocysteine levels, C-reactive protein levels, and kidney filtration rates.\n- Multivitamins are an affordable and low-risk way to improve overall health, even for individuals following a healthy diet.\n- When choosing a multivitamin, look for brands that invest in research, source raw materials from reputable sources, and use methylated nutrients with proven [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability).\n- Consider adding kettlebell [strength training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) to your routine for additional health benefits.\n## Kettlebells [(00:39:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=2372s)\n- [Vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D) is considered the most important compound in the human body.\n- A 50-55lb kettlebell or a trap bar with plates are versatile and effective for compound movements.\n- The trap bar can be used for various exercises, including farmers walks, deadlifts, squats, shoulder presses, and hammer curls.\n- The hex bar is preferred over a squat bar for deadlifts due to its safety.\n- [Ozone therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_therapy) and other expensive methods are not discussed in detail.\n- Two methods with good documentation for reversing biological age are [red light therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_laser_therapy) and [NAD+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide).\n## Red Light Therapy Bed & Hypermax Oxygen System [(00:41:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2n16DbVT0&t=2466s)\n- Red [light therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy) bed and hypermax [oxygen system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_mask) are two longevity tools discussed.\n- Hypermax oxygen system involves exercise with [oxygen therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy) (EWAT) based on multi-step oxygen theory.\n- EWAT uses an oxygen concentrator to breathe 93-95% oxygen for 10-12 minutes during mild exercise.\n- EWAT is considered a prolific tool for age reversal and extending life due to the importance of oxygen in preventing disease.\n- Hypoxia, or lack of oxygen to the brain, is the underlying cause of death and various diseases.\n- EWAT is more affordable and time-efficient compared to hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\n- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy requires a significant time commitment of at least 90 minutes, three times a week.\n- Hyperbaric [oxygen therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_therapy) may not be necessary for longevity purposes unless there are specific medical conditions.\n- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy systems can cost around $5,500, while hyperbaric chambers can range from $15,000 to $25,000.\n- Gary Brecka can be found on

[(00:00:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=11s)\n- Jerry and Marge Selby, a retired couple from Michigan, discovered a mathematical loophole in a lottery game called \"Windfall\" that allowed them to consistently win millions of dollars.\n- They formed a corporation, GS Investment Strategies, to manage their winnings and invited friends and family to invest in their lottery scheme.\n- After Michigan shut down the Windfall game, they found a similar game in [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts) called \"Cash Winfall\" and continued their winning streak.\n- Over the course of six years, they invested $4.2 million per year and won an average of $600,000 per play, resulting in an overall profit.\n- Despite the physical and mental demands of their lottery operation, they found great satisfaction and enjoyment in their success.\n- Their success caught the attention of the media, leading to an investigation by the Massachusetts state treasurer to uncover any potential organized crime or corruption.\n- The investigation revealed that the Selbees' winnings were the result of their mathematical expertise and strategic betting, not illegal activities.\n- The Selbees remained humble and used their profits practically, renovating their home and supporting their family's education.\n## 90+ (Part 1) [(00:13:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=838s)\n- The 90 Plus Study is a groundbreaking research study that aims to understand the factors that contribute to longevity and healthy aging in individuals aged 90 and above.\n- The study has found that many participants, like Lou Tado and Sid Shiro, are in excellent physical and mental shape despite their advanced age.\n- Regular exercise, even as little as 15 minutes a day, was associated with increased longevity, while non-physical activities such as book clubs, socializing, and playing board games also contributed to longer lifespans.\n- Contrary to popular belief, clean living and taking vitamins did not significantly impact longevity, but moderate alcohol consumption (up to two drinks a day) was associated with a reduced risk of death.\n- The study also found that maintaining or even gaining weight in old age was associated with increased longevity, while being underweight was detrimental.\n- The 90 Plus Study is generating provocative and surprising findings in the areas of Alzheimer's and [Dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia) and will discuss romance and sex life after the age of 90.\n## 90+ (Part 2) [(00:26:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=1605s)\n- The number of [Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans) aged 90 and above is projected to quadruple by midcentury, increasing the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n- The 90 plus study follows participants aged 90 and above, asking them to donate their brains after death to compare their life experiences with their brain structures.\n- Contrary to common belief, the risk of developing dementia doubles every five years starting at age 65 and continues to increase with age.\n- Diagnosing dementia is challenging as there are no definitive tests, and a diagnosis can only be confirmed by examining the brain after death.\n- Neuropathologist Dr. Ronald Kim examines donated brains, finding that in 40% of cases in people over 90, what appears to be Alzheimer's is not confirmed in the brain.\n- Dr. Kim found evidence of tiny microscopic strokes called micro infarcts in the brains of some participants, suggesting that these strokes may contribute to cognitive decline.\n- High blood pressure in older individuals may be linked to a lower risk of dementia.\n- A new type of PET scan can detect plaques during life, allowing researchers to study individuals with no signs of dementia who have plaques and tangles.\n- Alzheimer's disease may not be solely caused by plaques or micro-infarcts, but rather a combination of factors and \"hits\" that accumulate over time.\n- The 90+ study has received additional funding to research risk factors for specific types of dementia and identify protective genes.\n- Key factors mentioned for healthy aging include drinking wine, consuming coffee, socializing, exercising, and gaining weight.\n## 90+ (Part 3) [(00:39:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=2384s)\n- The 90 Plus study at the [University of California Irvine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine) is researching factors associated with longer life and memory in people aged 90 and above.\n- Key factors associated with longevity include exercise, moderate alcohol and caffeine consumption, social engagement, and maintaining a slightly higher weight as we age.\n- The study's focus has shifted to memory and dementia, with researchers finding that more children born today are expected to reach their 103rd or 104th birthday.\n- Dementia is a complex syndrome with various causes beyond just Alzheimer's disease, and scientists are continually learning more about its complexities.\n- Participants who donate their brains after passing away contribute to the study's findings, helping researchers better understand the aging process and dementia.\n- A newly identified cause of dementia, [TDP43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAR_DNA-binding_protein_43), was found in the brain of a 99-year-old participant named Ted, who did not have the proteins usually associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n- TDP43 is a protein originally found in [ALS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALS) patients and is believed to account for up to one in five cases of dementia in people over 90.\n- Some people with a significant amount of [brain pathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Pathology), such as Henry Torell, maintain normal cognitive function, suggesting the existence of protective factors or resilience against dementia.\n- The 90 Plus Study continues to investigate the factors contributing to resilience and healthy aging, aiming to help individuals reach old age with preserved cognitive function.\n## An Unlikely Inventor [(00:53:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtv5COcjGhw&t=3180s)\n- [Marshall Medoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Medoff), an 81-year-old inventor from Massachusetts, has dedicated over a decade to transforming inedible plant life into environmentally friendly transportation fuels.\n- Despite having no formal scientific education, Medoff became obsessed with the environment and decided to pursue his passion as an amateur scientist.\n- Medoff's key challenge was to extract sugar molecules from cellulose, the main component of plant cell walls, which is difficult to access cheaply and cleanly.\n- Medoff eventually hired Craig Masterman, an [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) graduate in chemistry, to help him build a lab and implement his ideas using electron accelerators to break apart the cellulose and release the sugars.\n- Medoff's company, Zyo, has developed a sugar-based bioplastic that can be programmed to disintegrate over specific time spans, addressing the issue of plastic waste accumulation.\n- Zyo also produces environmentally friendly biofuels, such as ethanol, gasoline, and jet fuel, from plant sugars, with significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels.\n- Medoff's innovative approach has attracted investors and prominent figures to Zyo's board of directors, including former [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_plc) oil executive Sir John Jennings and three former cabinet secretaries.\n- Medoff's biofuel has the potential to make a significant dent in the petroleum market, possibly reducing it by 30%.\n- Medoff's plant-based fuels, Cyose fuels, can be easily integrated into existing gas station pumps, making them convenient for consumers.","## Increasing Lifespan and Mortality Trends\n- The average lifespan is

improving muscle health supports brain health, body health, movement, and the health of every organ system in the body.\n- Dr. Lyon provides science-based protocols for everyday life, including specific dietary choices, food quantities, and efficient training regimens.\n- These protocols can significantly enhance muscle health and, consequently, the health of the entire brain and body.\n- The discussion is based on the latest research, clinical studies, and practical applications.\n## Sponsors: Maui Nui, Levels & Helix Sleep [(00:03:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=203s)\n- [Maui Nui venison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui_Nui_Venison) is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available.\n- Maui Nui venison has an extremely high-quality protein per calorie ratio.\n- Maui Nui venison jerky sticks have 10g of high-quality protein per stick at just 55 calories.\n- Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous glucose monitor.\n- Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep needs.\n- Dr. Gabrielle Lyon is a physician, scientist, and author who specializes in women's health and longevity.\n- She is the founder and director of the Women's Health Research Institute at [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University).\n- Dr. Lyon's research focuses on the role of nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle factors in promoting women's health and longevity.\n- She is a leading expert on the science of aging and has published over 100 scientific papers on the topic.\n- Dr. Lyon is also a sought-after speaker and has given lectures all over the world on the topics of women's health, aging, and nutrition.\n- She is the author of several books, including \"[The Longevity Diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longevity_Diet)\" and \"The Menopause Reset.\"\n## Skeletal Muscle & Longevity [(00:07:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=460s)\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) is the organ of longevity.\n- It is responsible for 80% of glucose disposal.\n- It is an amino acid reservoir.\n- It is the body armor that we all know and it is really responsible for how we age.\n- Muscle is not very metabolically active at rest.\n- For every pound of skeletal muscle, it might at rest burn 10 calories primarily burning fatty acids at rest.\n## “Under-muscled”, Leucine & Muscle Health [(00:11:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=685s)\n- Being under-muscled is a problem that can be addressed through [resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training).\n- Increasing muscle mass is compatible with overall health and distinct from bodybuilding.\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) mass is important for optimal health, but there is no clear definition of how much is optimal.\n- [DEXA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry) scans are used to measure lean tissue, but they do not provide information about the health or quality of skeletal muscle mass.\n- The health of skeletal muscle is linked to blood markers such as triglycerides, insulin, and glucose.\n- [Sarcopenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopenia), a decrease in muscle mass and function, is a recently classified disease.\n- Skeletal muscle is a nutrient-sensing organ that is sensitive to the quality of the diet, particularly the amino acid [leucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine).\n- Consuming 30-50 grams of high-quality protein per meal stimulates muscle protein synthesis and muscle health.\n## Muscle Health [(00:15:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=955s)\n- Muscle health is not necessarily correlated with muscle size.\n- Inactivity can lead to unhealthy muscle, even in individuals with a lot of muscle mass.\n- Unhealthy muscle can have fat deposition, which affects its ability to contract and reduces mitochondrial efficiency.\n- Muscle health is characterized by the ability to adapt to changing demands, similar to packing for a trip.\n- Overeating, especially carbohydrates, can lead to overpacked [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle), resulting in elevated insulin, blood glucose, free fatty acids, and branch-chain amino acids.\n## Tool: Carbohydrate Consumption & Activity, Glycogen [(00:19:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=1185s)\n- Muscle glycogen stores energy and can be depleted through intensive exercise. The liver stores about 100 grams of glycogen, while skeletal muscle can store up to 500 grams.\n- Carbohydrates should be consumed in small amounts throughout the day, with 40-50 grams per meal outside of exercise. A sedentary person should consume around 130 grams of carbohydrates per day, while an active person can consume up to 250 grams per day.\n- The brain is a primary user of carbohydrates, and individuals who engage in a lot of mental activity may need to consume more carbohydrates.\n- Carbohydrates provide four calories per gram, and a daily intake of 200 grams of carbohydrates is recommended. The remaining calories should be made up of a combination of protein and fat.\n- Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, while fat provides energy and helps absorb certain vitamins.\n- A balanced diet that includes a variety of healthy foods from all food groups is important for optimal health and longevity.\n## Tools: Nutrition for Healthy Skeletal Muscle, First Meal [(00:25:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=1514s)\n- Prioritize [dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)) for healthy body composition and [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) mass.\n- Carbohydrates should not be the primary focus, and a safe recommendation is 130 grams per day.\n- The first meal of the day should contain 30 to 50 grams of dietary protein to support muscle health.\n- The timing of the first meal is not as crucial for young and healthy individuals but becomes more important with age.\n- Both meat and plant proteins can be beneficial, and dietary protein consists of 20 different amino acids, 9 of which are essential and must be obtained from food.\n- The essential amino acids for skeletal muscle health are the branch chain amino acids, with [leucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine) being particularly important.\n- Consuming 30 to 50 grams of protein at breakfast is necessary to adequately stimulate muscle protein synthesis and prevent [sarcopenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopenia) and obesity.\n## Sponsor: AG1 [(00:31:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=1917s)\n- Dr. [Huberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huberman) has been taking AG1 for over 10 years.\n- AG1 is a nutritional supplement that provides vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens.\n- Dr. Huberman takes AG1 once or twice a day to ensure he gets all the nutrients he needs.\n- AG1 is not a replacement for quality food but rather a supplement to help fill in any nutritional gaps.\n- Many people who take AG1 report feeling better in terms of energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.\n- AG1 is designed to support all aspects of well-being related to mental and physical health.\n- You can get a special offer on AG1 by going to drinkag1.com/[huberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huberman).\n- Dr. Huberman discusses the importance of exercise and nutrition for optimal health and longevity.\n- He emphasizes the importance of getting enough sleep, managing stress, and avoiding processed foods.\n- Dr. Huberman also provides specific recommendations for exercise and nutrition, including:\n - Exercise:\n - Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n - Include a mix of cardiovascular exercise, [strength training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training), and flexibility exercises.\n - Listen to your body and stop if you feel pain.\n - Nutrition:\n - Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n - Choose lean protein sources, such as fish, chicken, and beans.\n - Limit your intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats.\n - Drink plenty of water.\n- Dr. [Huberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Huberman) also discusses the importance of intermittent fasting and the benefits of a plant-based diet.\n## Quality Protein, Animal & Plant-Based Proteins [(00:33:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=2026s)\n- Quality of protein is defined by amino acid composition.\n- Animal-based proteins have higher quality amino acid composition compared to plant-based proteins.\n- Plant-based proteins have a different composition similar to plants and can provide enough essential amino acids if the total caloric load is high enough.\n- The American diet is 70% plant-based, mostly refined carbohydrates, sugars, and refined oils.\n- Plant-based proteins often have carbohydrates that come along with them, which is important for overall metabolic control.\n- A rice pea blend of protein can be used for the first meal for those on a plant-based diet.\n- There is no evidence that combining high-quality protein with carbohydrates in the first meal is more or less beneficial than having protein alone.\n- Combining carbohydrates with protein can provide diversity, fiber, and phytonutrients if combined with berries, but it is not necessary.\n## Dietary Protein Recommendations, Meal Threshold [(00:37:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=2256s)\n- The current [RDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake) for protein is based on nitrogen balance studies and is set at 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, which is the minimum to prevent a deficiency.\n- This recommendation has not changed since the 1980s, despite evidence suggesting that higher protein intake is beneficial for muscle health and healthy aging.\n- The RDA for [leucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine), an essential amino acid, is set at 2.7 grams per day, which is considered too low to support healthy aging or individuals with obesity or chronic illnesses.\n- Evidence suggests that a leucine intake of 2 to 3 times the RDA, closer to 9 grams per day, is needed for optimal health.\n- To meet this leucine requirement, a meal should contain at least 30 grams of protein, which is equivalent to a 4-ounce steak, six eggs, or a 25-gram whey protein shake.\n- Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is stimulated after exercise and lasts for about 2-3 hours.\n- Consuming protein after exercise can help maximize MPS and support muscle growth and recovery.\n- The amount of protein needed to stimulate MPS varies depending on individual factors such as age, activity level, and training goals.\n- In general, it is recommended to consume 0.25-0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight within 2-3 hours after exercise.\n- Protein sources such as whey protein, eggs, and lean meats are quickly digested and absorbed, making them ideal for post-workout consumption.\n- The timing of protein intake is important for maximizing muscle protein synthesis and muscle growth.\n- Consuming protein throughout the day, including at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, is beneficial for maintaining muscle mass and supporting overall health.\n- Spreading protein intake across multiple meals and snacks can help ensure a consistent supply of amino acids to the muscles.\n- Skipping meals or going long periods without protein intake can lead to muscle loss and decreased muscle protein synthesis.\n## Muscle Health & Aging [(00:41:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=2479s)\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) health is crucial for healthy aging.\n- Two main ways to stimulate skeletal muscle: [resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) and [dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)).\n- Aging impairs the efficiency of muscle protein synthesis, leading to [sarcopenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopenia).\n- Sarcopenia can affect young individuals as well, not just the elderly.\n- Muscle span is the concept of maintaining skeletal muscle health throughout life.\n- Skeletal muscle health begins early in life and is influenced by factors such as protein intake and physical activity.\n- Sedentary lifestyle is a disease state in itself.\n- Older individuals require more protein per meal (40-50 grams) compared to younger individuals (30 grams) to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) in older individuals can mount a youthful response to increased [dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)).\n## Supplements & Creatine; Dietary Protein [(00:46:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=2762s)\n- Do not supplement with [leucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine) alone, as it affects the levels of other amino acids.\n- Supplement with essential amino acids or BCAAs if you have a low protein meal.\n- [Creatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine) affects skeletal muscle health at 5 grams and brain health at 12 grams.\n- A 6-ounce steak or four scrambled eggs provide a small amount of creatine (around 2 grams).\n- We eat mixed meals, not single nutrients, so the quality of protein matters.\n- Plant-based proteins can provide all [dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)), but require a higher intake (1.6 grams per kg) compared to high-quality animal proteins.\n## Tool: Dietary Protein Recommendation; Gout & Cancer Risk [(00:50:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=3007s)\n- The recommended protein intake is 1 gram per pound of ideal body weight, not current body weight.\n- There is no evidence that a higher protein diet is detrimental to kidney or bone health.\n- The idea that a high protein diet can cause gout, liver issues, or increase the risk of [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer) is unfounded.\n- Red meat consumption does not necessarily increase the risk of cancer. Obesity is a primary risk factor for many cancers.\n- A protein-forward diet combined with [resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) optimizes body composition and reduces the risk of obesity-related cancers.\n- Focus on compound movements that work multiple muscle groups at once.\n- Incorporate progressive overload by gradually increasing the weight or intensity of your workouts over time.\n- Prioritize protein in your diet, aiming for 1 gram per pound of ideal body weight.\n- Choose whole, unprocessed foods and limit added sugars and unhealthy fats.\n- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.\n- Get enough sleep to allow your body to recover and repair.\n- Manage stress through relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing.\n- Maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.\n## Effects of Dietary Protein & Exercise on Body Composition [(00:52:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=3163s)\n- A 12-month study found that overweight men and women who followed the Zone diet (40% carbs, 30% protein, 30% fat) lost 24% more weight than those who followed a standard American diet (55% carbs, 8% protein, 30% fat), even though both groups exercised the same amount.\n- Distributing protein evenly throughout the day helps maintain muscle mass and promotes weight loss.\n- A high protein diet, combined with [resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training), can lead to even greater fat loss and muscle preservation.\n- Individuals who consumed 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and exercised lost significantly more body weight, fat, and less fat-free mass compared to those who consumed the recommended daily allowance of protein and exercised.\n## Thermic Effects, Protein [(01:03:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=3786s)\n- The thermic effect of food refers to the energy required to metabolize macronutrients.\n- Carbohydrates require about 3-5% of their energy for metabolism, while protein requires 20-30%.\n- The energy used for protein metabolism is primarily for muscle protein synthesis, not nitrogen handling.\n- Optimal utilization of protein occurs when a minimum of 30 grams is consumed per dose.\n## Sponsor: InsideTracker [(01:05:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=3902s)\n- InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes blood and DNA data to provide insights into health and personalized recommendations for improvement.\n- InsideTracker provides specific directives related to nutrition, behavior modification, and supplementation to help individuals optimize their health.\n- InsideTracker membership offers discounted prices on comprehensive blood panels.\n## Protein & Satiety, Insulin & Glucose [(01:06:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=3974s)\n- Eating protein and vegetables or fruits without starchy carbohydrates leads to a different experience compared to eating starchy carbohydrates alone.\n- The protein leverage hypothesis suggests that individuals continue eating to satisfy an amino acid need.\n- Dietary carbohydrates cause an insulinogenic effect, leading to lower blood sugar and potential overeating, while [dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)) causes a lesser insulin release.\n- The body can generate its own glucose through gluconeogenesis when consuming a higher protein diet.\n- Essential amino acids are crucial for various bodily functions, including serotonin production, mucin production in the gut, and [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) health.\n- [Leucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine) is the primary essential amino acid for skeletal muscle health, and focusing on eating for the needs of skeletal muscle health can positively impact overall health and well-being.\n## Tool: Older Adults, Resistance Training & Dietary Protein [(01:12:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=4324s)\n- Protein intake is crucial for maintaining muscle health and preventing muscle loss, especially as we age.\n- Consuming a high-quality protein breakfast can improve muscle health and mass even without resistance exercise, particularly for older adults.\n- [Resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) and [dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)) are essential for stimulating skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, becoming increasingly important with age.\n- Aim for 1 gram of protein per pound of ideal body weight or 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight to support healthy aging.\n- The general population recommendations for exercise and eating for optimal health and longevity have not changed since 2010.\n- Combining exercise with a healthy diet is necessary for muscles to respond to exercise and maintain [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) health.\n## Dietary Protein, mTOR & Cancer Risk [(01:17:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=4668s)\n- Protein loading without exercise is not advisable due to mTOR's effect throughout the body.\n- [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) (mechanistic Target of rapamycin) is a protein complex that should not be constantly stimulated to minimize [cancer risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer).\n- mTOR is highly expressed in all cells during early development and growth, but its expression decreases over time.\n- Replacing mTOR in cells can make them appear and behave like young cells again, even restoring some regenerative capacity.\n- Increasing mTOR through various means can cause cells to grow enormously, potentially promoting the proliferation of pre-existing tumors.\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) is uniquely sensitive to contraction, which inhibits mTOR and allows for muscle protein synthesis.\n- The misconception that increased [dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)) causes cancer is a narrow perspective, as [resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training), which also stimulates mTOR, does not lead to cancer.\n- Some individuals take rapamycin to inhibit [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR) in hopes of extending their lifespan, but this can have negative effects on muscle growth and health.\n- mTOR has distinct roles in different tissues and at different time points throughout the lifespan.\n- Ingesting quality protein and resistance training can increase muscle protein synthesis via mTOR and other pathways.\n- Resistance training, despite stimulating mTOR, is not considered detrimental in the longevity space.\n## Muscle Span & Aging, Sedentary Behaviors [(01:21:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=4896s)\n- Muscle stimulation efficiency declines with age.\n- Muscle span is important for maintaining muscle health as we age.\n- A diet rich in protein and regular movement can help maintain muscle health.\n- Aging is the great equalizer and creating good habits is essential for healthy aging.\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) health is crucial for longevity and is often overlooked.\n- Skeletal muscle insulin resistance can occur even in young, healthy individuals who are sedentary.\n- Sedentary behavior is a disease state and should not be considered innocuous.\n## Mixed Meals, Protein Quality, Fiber [(01:24:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=5040s)\n- Aim for 1 gram of quality protein per pound of target body weight per day.\n- Distribute protein intake into meals that include 30 to 50 grams of protein per meal.\n- The first and last meals of the day are the most important for protein intake.\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) protein synthesis maxes out at around 55 grams of protein per meal.\n- Any protein ingested beyond what can be used for muscle protein synthesis is oxidized for energy.\n- A mixed meal with 50 grams of quality protein and 50 grams of carbohydrates will slow down absorption and digestion.\n- The quality of protein is important in a mixed meal to reach a threshold in the blood to stimulate tissue.\n- A mixed meal with 40 grams of protein from both animal and plant sources stimulated muscle protein synthesis, while a mixed meal with just plant-based proteins did not.\n- Fiber is valuable for the gut microbiome, satiation, and overall health.\n- Prioritize [dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)) when designing a diet, then parse out the rest of the carbohydrates based on exercise level.\n- Choose high-fiber sources of carbohydrates such as berries.\n## Inactivity & Insulin Resistance, Inflammation [(01:29:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=5361s)\n- Insulin resistance, a major contributor to childhood obesity and hypertension, can be improved through regular exercise.\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) plays a vital role in nutrient consumption and insulin-independent glucose transport, with physical activity increasing the density of glute 4 receptors for improved glucose movement.\n- Despite the significance of muscle contraction, glute 4 expression, and exercise in promoting metabolic health, public health officials often overlook their importance.\n- Muscle health, encompassing strength, power, and the ability to perform eccentric movements, is crucial for optimal health and longevity, preventing life-ending injuries and preserving the body's architecture.\n- Inactivity and muscle loss can lead to metabolic derangement, fatty acid infiltration, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation.\n## Exercise & Myokines, Brain Health & BDNF [(01:38:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=5923s)\n- Skeletal muscle plays a vital role in overall health and longevity.\n- [Resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) releases myokines like [interleukin-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6) and irisin, which improve glucose utilization, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the release of [brain-derived neurotrophic factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor) (BDNF) in the brain.\n- BDNF is involved in neurogenesis and the consolidation of neural connections, helping maintain and improve brain function over time.\n- Resistance training is crucial for maintaining healthy [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) mass, essential for overall survivability and resistance to diseases like [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer).\n- Myokines released from skeletal muscle interact with immune system cells, influencing cytokine production and potentially modulating the inflammatory response.\n## Tool: Resistance Training Protocols, Hypertrophy, “High Ground” [(01:44:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=6251s)\n- Dr. Gabrielle Lyon recommends resistance training for optimal health and longevity, focusing on compound movements that work multiple muscle groups through a full range of motion.\n- [Resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) should be a lifelong habit, and it's never too young or too old to start. Bodyweight resistance exercises are sufficient for many individuals, especially children and beginners.\n- The primary goal of resistance training should be hypertrophy, which is the growth of skeletal muscle mass, rather than simply maintaining muscle mass.\n- Training for hypertrophy with 5-10 reps and 3-4 sets is effective for muscle health.\n- Activities that focus on hypertrophy and maintaining type two muscle fibers are essential for overall health and longevity.\n## High Ground Exercises; Tendon Strength; Training Duration, Blue Zones [(01:52:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=6771s)\n- Tendon strength takes time to develop, with a turnover rate of 0.5 to 1.5% per day, while muscle turnover is 1 to 2% per day.\n- A typical [resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) workout should include a 10-15 minute warm-up, 50-60 minutes of intense exercise, and a cool-down.\n- Avoid overtraining and leave some energy in reserve.\n- A three-day per week full-body workout is suitable for many individuals, especially beginners, with weekly progression for beginners and smaller improvements for advanced lifters.\n- Current physical activity guidelines recommend 5,000 daily steps, 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity, and two days of resistance training per week.\n- Many people are considered sedentary, falling short of these guidelines.\n- The blue zones, where people live longer and healthier lives, emphasize general physical activity and a higher protein intake rather than weight lifting.\n- Exercise is more crucial for overall body homeostasis compared to diet alone.\n- Protein consumption without exercise may not effectively prevent muscle loss.\n## Movement, Exercise & Older Adults [(01:58:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=7099s)\n- Regular dynamic movement and coordination, such as skiing or tennis, can contribute to brain health and prevent brain atrophy.\n- [Resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) is crucial for maintaining muscle mass and overall health, especially for older individuals who often neglect it.\n- Intensity in training, rather than duration, is key for maintaining muscle mass as we age.\n- Lifting moderately heavy weights is sufficient for maintaining muscle mass in older adults, while extremely heavy loads are unnecessary.\n- Body composition changes, such as increased visceral body fat, can be positively influenced by combining training and proper nutrition.\n- Muscle quality should be defined by both functional movement measurements and the architecture and infrastructure of the [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle).\n- Dr. William Evans developed a method using D3 [creatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine) to directly measure skeletal muscle mass, which has not been done appropriately in the past.\n- Skeletal muscle mass and strength are both important for overall health.\n## Tool: Protein Timing & Resistance Training; VO2 Max, Aging, Blood Work [(02:04:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=7465s)\n- Consuming quality protein within an hour of [resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training), especially for older individuals or those with chronic conditions, can enhance muscle health and longevity.\n- A lower protein diet combined with resistance training can benefit from consuming a protein shake post-workout due to quicker absorption.\n- Cardiovascular training for V2 Max can be achieved through various methods, including slow steady-state activity, high-intensity interval training, moderate-intensity interval training, sprint interval training, or improving [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) mass through strength and hypertrophy training.\n- The ultimate goal is to maintain optimal health and longevity by achieving clinical outcomes such as appropriate blood pressure, low triglyceride levels, and healthy fasting insulin and glucose levels.\n- Higher protein diets and increased muscle mass can lead to higher blood glucose and creatinine levels.\n- Intense resistance training can cause transient elevations in ALT and liver enzymes.\n- Regular exercise, such as ultra-running, can help maintain muscle health and longevity.\n## Supplements: Creatine, Urolithin A, Whey Protein, Fish Oil, Collagen [(02:11:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=7873s)\n- [Creatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine) monohydrate improves muscle strength and brain function, especially in postmenopausal women and older adults.\n- Uthan A, a gut microbiome-derived postbiotic, enhances mitophagy, strength, and endurance.\n- A healthy gut microbiome is essential for translating [resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) into improved muscle health.\n- Whey protein concentrate or isolate provides essential amino acids and has minimal drawbacks, making it an excellent supplement for muscle health.\n- Fish oil [omega-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid) fatty acids positively impact brain function and may promote muscle growth.\n- The recommended daily intake of fish oil is around 4 grams, but some individuals may require up to 10 grams.\n- Blood tests can determine the optimal ratio of Omega-3 to [Omega-6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-6_fatty_acid) fatty acids.\n- Collagen benefits skin, hair, nails, and potentially tendons.\n- A higher dose of collagen, approximately 25 grams per day, may be necessary for optimal results.\n- Collagen can be conveniently consumed once daily and can be added to coffee or broth.\n## Fasting, Older Adults; Tool: Meal Timing [(02:20:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=8418s)\n- Dr. Gabrielle Lyon inadvertently practices intermittent fasting with her first meal at 11:00 a.m. and last meal around 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., resulting in a 2 to 4 meal eating window.\n- Benefits of fasting:\n - Calorie restriction\n - Bowel rest\n- Fasting may not be suitable for older individuals or those struggling to build muscle due to the need to balance muscle protein synthesis and catabolism.\n- Fasting can make it challenging to consume the recommended 30 to 50 grams of protein per meal to reach the goal of 1 gram of protein per pound of ideal body weight.\n- The first meal of the day, whenever consumed, has been studied for its impact on muscle protein synthesis.\n- Eating 30 to 50 grams of protein in the first meal triggers a muscle protein synthetic response that lasts for 2 hours.\n- Other initiation factors, like eif4, maintain themselves for an additional 4 to 5 hours.\n- The second meal is not necessarily about muscle protein synthesis, but it contributes to better 24-hour protein response and nitrogen balance.\n- The goal of the second meal is to consume enough protein to meet the daily requirement of 1 gram per pound of ideal body weight.\n- The final meal before fasting supports overnight protein synthesis, as the body draws from muscle to maintain energy balance during the fasted state.\n- For hypertrophy, adding an additional fourth meal would be beneficial in supporting muscle growth.\n## Animal Proteins & Dairy; Organ Meats, Vegan; Magnesium, Zinc [(02:25:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=8718s)\n- Milk protein casein is slower absorbing and may be beneficial for muscle health, especially closer to bedtime.\n- High saturated fat dairy can be good for health and longevity.\n- Liver is high in fat-soluble vitamins and iron.\n- [Salmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_as_food) is a quality protein higher in fat, and fish has less protein per ounce compared to meat.\n- Heart is a good protein source and high in [CoQ10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10), beneficial for muscle health.\n- Rice and pea protein blends are suitable options for vegans, and fermented protein powders have a similar profile to whey protein.\n- A vegan diet can be challenging as individuals age, requiring attention to B12, zinc, and iron intake.\n- Magnesium supplementation can be beneficial due to its depletion in the diet and its importance for overall health.\n- Zinc supplementation is not necessary if you follow a whole foods diet.\n- Zinc and copper ratios are considered indicators of overall brain health.\n## Medications & Muscle Health [(02:30:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=9059s)\n- Ibuprofen, especially in high doses, may negatively impact muscle health, hypertrophy, and strength.\n- Statin use can cause muscle pain, soreness, and deplete [CoQ10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10).\n- Anti-inflammatory medications like aspirin and [NSAIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug) can suppress [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) hypertrophy and strength at certain doses.\n- Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, can affect collagen and tendon turnover, increasing the risk of injuries like Achilles injuries.\n- [Proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydron_(chemistry)) pump inhibitors used for stomach acid or reflux can affect the absorption of vitamins and minerals, leading to long-lasting effects.\n## Obesity & GLP-1 Analogs, Ozempic, Mounjaro, Skeletal Muscle [(02:32:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=9169s)\n- [GLP-1 analogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLP-1_receptor_agonist) like Ozempic and [Mounjaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirzepatide) are effective in promoting significant weight loss, with Ozempic causing an average of 13% weight loss and Mounjaro causing up to 22% weight loss over 24 weeks.\n- GLP-1 analogs can also improve alcohol consumption and other addictions.\n- These medications have been used safely for over a decade and their benefits outweigh the risks.\n- GLP-1 analogs require ongoing proper nutrition and exercise to maintain weight loss.\n- Protein has a satiating effect due to its stimulation of GLP-1.\n- The amount of protein required for muscle protein synthesis and muscle health is similar to the amount that significantly impacts GLP-1 release.\n## Benefits of Skeletal Muscle & Aging [(02:40:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=9648s)\n- [Skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) is the organ of longevity.\n- Healthy muscle is associated with better metabolic health, blood pressure, survivability, strength, mobility, and body armor.\n- Skeletal muscle is the only organ system with voluntary control and the only endocrine organ system with voluntary control.\n## Tools: Nutrition & Resistance Training for Muscle Health [(02:42:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=9736s)\n- [Dietary protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)) is the top nutrition-based tool for improving muscle health.\n- Protein hierarchy: roughly 1 gram per pound of ideal body weight, up to 1.7 grams per pound of ideal body weight.\n- Quality of protein matters, especially for older individuals or those with health challenges.\n- Protein distribution is less important for those consuming a high-protein diet.\n- Carbohydrates are helpful for fiber, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals.\n- Carbohydrate threshold: start at 130 grams and titrate up or down based on metabolic health and activity level.\n- Outside of activity, 50 grams or less of carbohydrates is recommended to mitigate substantial insulin response.\n- Fat can be chosen as desired and typically comes within a meal.\n- [Resistance training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training) is non-negotiable for muscle health.\n- Start with body weight or bands if needed, then move to load.\n- Aim for two to three days of resistance training per week.\n- Volume and intensity should be adjusted based on individual needs.\n- High-intensity interval training is recommended over slow steady-state cardio.\n## Mindset Tools: Standards vs. Goals; Vulnerability Points [(02:45:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=9944s)\n- Mindset and self-directed health are key to achieving optimal health and longevity.\n- Setting standards for oneself, rather than goals, is essential for effective execution and results.\n- Identifying patterns of people, not just diseases, allows physicians to leverage individuals' strengths and weaknesses for better outcomes.\n- Understanding one's points of vulnerability is crucial for staying on track and maintaining health.\n- Maintaining a level of neutrality is necessary for overall success, as the healthiest individuals are able to maintain this balance.\n- Long-term strategies for overall health are essential as the window of youth closes and diligence in health responsibilities becomes more important.\n## Mindset Tools: Neutrality; Health & Worth [(02:52:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFcYF_pxLgA&t=10320s)\n- Emotional neutrality aids in managing emotional extremes, promoting health and well-being, and can be developed over time.\n- Feeling worthy of health and wellness is crucial for achieving optimal health, as individuals who don't feel worthy may sabotage their efforts and focus on negative aspects.\n- Muscle is essential for maintaining health, longevity, and health span.\n- Mindset tools are vital for success in any health plan, and Dr. Gabrielle Lyon provides practical tools for nutrition, exercise, supplementation, and mindset.\n- Dr. Lyon supports communities in need, such as the military community, and shares her knowledge through various platforms, including [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media), her podcast, and her book.\n## Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube

called \"The Dr. Gabrielle Lyon Show.\"\n- Her website has additional resources on women's health and longevity.\n- Resistance training is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass, which is important for overall health and longevity.\n- Resistance training can also help to improve bone density, reduce body fat, and improve insulin sensitivity.\n- The best resistance training program includes a variety of exercises that target all major muscle groups.\n- It is important to lift weights heavy enough to challenge the muscles, but not so heavy that form is compromised.\n- Start with a weight that allows you to do 8-12 repetitions with good form.\n- Gradually increase the weight as you get stronger.\n- Focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses.\n- Do 2-3 sets of each exercise.\n- Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets.\n- Train each muscle group 2-3 times per week.\n- Make sure to warm up before your workout and cool down afterwards.\n- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.\n- Listen to your body and stop if you feel pain.\n- Eat a diet rich in whole, unprocessed foods.\n- Focus on eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein.\n- Choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, avocado, and nuts.\n- Limit your intake of added sugar, saturated fat, and processed foods.\n- Drink plenty of water.\n- Avoid sugary drinks, such as soda and juice.\n- Limit your alcohol intake.\n- Eat a variety of foods to ensure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs.\n- Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian if you have any questions about your diet.\n- Get 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n- Create a relaxing bedtime routine to help you fall asleep more easily.\n- Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.\n- Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n- If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor.\n- Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, yoga, meditation, or spending time in nature.\n- Avoid chronic stress, as it can have negative effects on your health.\n- Talk to a therapist if you

multivitamin.\n- Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements.","## Kicking Off Episode Four: Longevity Molecules [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=0s)\n- [Dr. David Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Sinclair), professor at [Harvard Medical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School) and expert on aging, and his co-host Matthew LaPlante start the episode focusing on longevity supplements.\n- They emphasize that they are not medical doctors and advise listeners to consult their physicians before trying new supplements.\n- The episode aims to answer common questions about supplements like [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide), [NR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside), [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin), and how they can potentially slow or reverse aging.\n\n## An Additional Boost Beyond Adversity Mimetics [(00:04:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=286s)\n- The concept of 'adversity mimetics,' like fasting and exercise, is discussed, but these may not be enough for modern lifestyles.\n- David Sinclair has been using an additional supplement regimen since his early thirties to enhance wellness and long-term health.\n\n## Drugs vs. Supplements and Highlight Points [(00:05:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=352s)\n- The episode clarifies the difference between drugs regulated by the [FDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) and supplements that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS).\n- Discussion on the importance of being cautious with supplements, especially regarding the liver and the potential need for medical supervision.\n- A shortlist of the most popular and promising molecules aiding health spans and lifespans is introduced, including [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) boosters, Metformin, berberine, rapamycin, spermidine, resveratrol, fisetin, and quercetin.\n- References and show notes are provided to allow listeners to explore the topics discussed in greater detail.\n\n## Longevity Molecules Target the Survival Circuit [(00:09:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=594s)\n- Longevity pathways, like [sirtuins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin), [AMPK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP-activated_protein_kinase), and [mTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTOR), are framed as the focus for understanding how various supplements function.\n- These survival pathways are responsive to environmental conditions and can interact with each other in complex ways.\n- New research further elucidates how molecules thought to affect only one pathway can impact others as well.\n\n## NAD Boosters [(00:11:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=693s)\n- NAD is crucial for cellular energy transfer and overall bodily function; a decline in NAD levels can impede the body's ability to combat aging.\n- [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels are naturally depleted with age, even with exercise and a healthy diet.\n- Supplements like NMN and NR can potentially restore NAD levels akin to those of younger people, thus supporting the sirtuins' defensive response against aging.\n\n## Nicotinamide Riboside [(00:13:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=812s)\n- Nicotinamide riboside ([NR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside)) is the most well-known and studied NAD booster, used since 2014 either alone or in combination with other molecules.\n- It's considered a safe molecule, with studies indicating that doses of 250 mg to 1 g per day can raise [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels in blood with little to no side effects.\n- NR activates the sirtuin pathway in yeast (as discovered in the early 2000s), mirroring the effects of caloric restriction and increasing lifespan by about 30%.\n- NR is taken up by cells and converted to NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide), which is then assembled into NAD.\n- In mice, [NR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside) supplementation led to a 9% lifespan increase when given late in life, along with health improvements such as increased mitochondria, athleticism, and reduced inflammation.\n- NR enhances oxidative metabolism in animals, resulting in fat loss and potential diabetes prevention through increased oxygen consumption.\n- Human studies on NR have shown mixed results; some benefits like lower inflammation and minor changes in body composition have been observed, but improvements in blood sugar, insulin sensitivity, and mitochondria observed in mice are unconfirmed in short term human studies.\n- A combination of [NR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside) and a resveratrol-like molecule showed improvement in ALS patients' daily function, indicating potential but inconclusive results on NR's long-term effects.\n\n## Nicotinamide Mononucleotide [(00:21:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=1286s) \n\n- Research community is divided into team [NR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside) (Nicotinamide Riboside) and team NMN ([Nicotinamide Mononucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide)).\n- NMN is the focus of [Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Sinclair)'s lab; it appears to work better than NR in empirical studies, although it's unclear why.\n- [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) is more expensive to produce than NR due to the additional phosphate molecule.\n- There's a specific transporter, SLC128A, that may take NMN into cells.\n- Animal studies show NMN enhances insulin sensitivity, restores NAD levels, and may improve lifespan by 10-15%, particularly in females.\n- Human studies on [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) are less common, but increasing, with early results showing improved insulin sensitivity; larger doses are being tested in clinical trials.\n- There's anticipation for more extensive human clinical trial results in 2022 to compare with animal study outcomes.\n- Other more effective [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) boosting molecules (new chemical entities, or NCEs) are being developed for future human studies.\n\n## NAD Intravenous Drips [(00:29:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=1762s)\n\n- Intravenous NAD is being used outside of clinical trials, claimed to improve mood and energy, treat addiction, depression, and hangovers.\n- NAD is a coenzyme needed by alcohol dehydrogenase, which detoxifies alcohol, and taking NMN or [NR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside) may replenish [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) and alleviate hangovers.\n- Despite anecdotal evidence, there's no definitive proof from placebo-controlled trials regarding the efficacy of NAD IVs.\n- The focus in research started with smaller precursors like NMN and NR because NAD itself does not efficiently enter cells.\n- [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) has a transporter protein that significantly facilitates its uptake into cells, potentially making it more effective than [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) or NR for increasing intracellular NAD levels.\n\n## Bioavailability of NAD Boosters [(00:32:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=1965s) \n- Swallowing [NR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside) and NMN capsules or powder is sufficient to raise NAD levels by two to three fold.\n- Sublingual versions and injections are also options, but there is no strong evidence suggesting they are superior to oral ingestion.\n- Simply swallowing the supplement has been shown to effectively boost [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels.\n\n## NAD and Cancer [(00:33:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=2020s) \n- Concerns about NAD boosters potentially stimulating cancer growth due to studies in mice.\n- One study indicated that reduced NAD levels can slow the growth of brain tumors in mice.\n- A 2019 study suggested that NMN might promote cancer growth in mice predisposed to pancreatic cancer by affecting the tumor suppressor gene [P53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53).\n- However, [NMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide) has been fed to normal mice, leading to longer and healthier lives, suggesting predisposition may be a factor.\n- It's important for people considering [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) boosters to consult their physicians due to potential cancer risks.\n\n## Resveratrol [(00:35:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=2133s) \n- [Resveratrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol) activates Sirt-1, which controls other proteins linked to longevity.\n- Discovered as a [Sirt-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin) activator, resveratrol gained attention because it is found in red wine.\n- Red wine sales increased significantly due to the association with resveratrol, although consuming adequate resveratrol through wine alone is impractical.\n- A dose of 250 milligrams per day of resveratrol is the minimum seen to be effective in human studies, with some taking up to 2000 milligrams.\n- Resveratrol should be mixed with fat for proper absorption as it does not dissolve in water.\n- Animal studies showed resveratrol protected against high-fat diets and mimicked caloric restriction.\n- Human studies have yielded mixed results but include benefits such as reduced fasting glucose, increased insulin sensitivity, lower cholesterol, and better kidney function.\n- Resveratrol has a background in cancer suppression, with various studies indicating its effectiveness against cancer, and benefits to body composition, metabolic rate, and mitochondrial function.\n\n## Red Wine and The French Paradox [(00:42:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=2546s) \n- The [French paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_paradox) refers to low rates of cardiovascular disease despite a high-fat diet, possibly mitigated by moderate red wine consumption.\n- Long-term, cumulative effects of drinking red wine, along with the presence of other polyphenols besides resveratrol, might contribute to the French paradox.\n\n\n## Fisetin and Quercetin [(00:43:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=2588s)\n- [Fisetin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisetin) and quercetin were initially identified as potential sirtuin activating molecules along with resveratrol.\n- Both are classified as senolytics, which means they assist in eliminating senescent cells (zombie-like cells that cause inflammation and cancer).\n- Research in mice has shown that fisetin can significantly extend lifespan and health, even when administered late in life.\n- Fisetin has been found naturally in foods like strawberries and is available for purchase online.\n- [Quercetin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin), combined with dasatinib (a leukemia drug), has shown remarkable effects in reducing inflammation and fatty liver in human clinical trials.\n- Fisetin is currently being tested in humans at 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight to determine its safety and efficacy.\n\n## Rapamycin and Rapalogs [(00:47:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=2829s)\n- [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) is an mTOR inhibitor and has a history of discovery on [Easter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island), initially found on a statue.\n- It is currently used for immune suppression and cancer treatment but is being researched for its potential to extend lifespan.\n- Low doses of rapamycin have been shown to extend life span across various organisms without immune suppression.\n- Rapalogs are drugs that aim to mimic rapamycin's effects without its potential toxicity.\n- By inhibiting mTOR, rapamycin and its analogs stimulate the body's autophagy process, recycling old proteins.\n\n## Spermidine [(00:49:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=2950s)\n- [Spermidine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermidine) promotes autophagy, similar to rapamycin, and has a historical connection to sperm crystals observed under a microscope.\n- In recent studies, spermidine has extended the lifespan of yeast, flies, worms, and mice, improving heart function and other youthful capacities.\n- Human studies focusing on memory enhancement have shown spermidine's potential in cognition improvement.\n- Spermidine is now sourced from wheat germ and soy products and is no longer obtained from sperm.\n\n## Sirtuin Activators\n- The discussion of fisetin and quercetin ties back to the broader category of sirtuin activators, which includes compounds known to impact aging and longevity by activating sirtuin pathways.\n\n## Metformin [(00:51:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=3087s)\n- Metformin, used since the 1950s to manage type 2 diabetes, excites interest for its potential in longevity.\n- It operates by activating AMPK, influencing the mitochondrial energy-making process, and promoting mitohormesis.\n- [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) triggers energy production, better insulin signaling, and also raises NAD levels, impacting multiple aging pathways.\n- Originating from the French lilac plant, Metformin has been shown to increase lifespan in animals and improve various health markers.\n- In humans, Metformin can lower the risks of age-related diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's.\n- [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) is inexpensive and off-patent, making funding for extensive longevity studies challenging.\n- There's a shift towards doctors prescribing Metformin off-label for anti-aging benefits.\n- The drug's side effects include gastrointestinal upset and potentially lactic acidosis, but it generally has a safe profile.\n- The \"tame\" study aims to provide evidence to FDA that Metformin can decelerate aging.\n- Some practitioners advise taking [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) on non-exercise days due to its impact on energy levels during workout.\n\n## Berberine [(01:00:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=3627s)\n- As an alternative to Metformin, berberine activates AMPK and shares several metabolic benefits.\n- Found in plants, berberine can promote mitochondrial function and improve insulin sensitivity.\n- [Berberine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berberine) dosage in clinical studies can range up to two grams per day, showing positive health effects.\n- It can cause similar side effects to Metformin, including digestive issues.\n- As a natural compound, berberine is readily available for trial, but consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended.\n\n## Dr. Sinclair’s Protocol for Longevity Molecules [(01:02:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=3763s)\n- Dr. David [Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Sinclair) has been taking about a gram of resveratrol daily since 2004, which must be mixed with fat to be effective.\n- He ingests resveratrol in the morning with yogurt or dissolved in olive oil, which also activates sirtuins.\n- Sinclair also takes a gram of NMN in the morning, which does not require food to be absorbed and has been shown to double NAD levels in human studies.\n- The specific timing for taking NMN and resveratrol in the morning is based on their role in the body's natural rise in [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) and Sirt-1 activity, which are part of a 24-hour clock.\n- He takes 800 milligrams of [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) at night to simulate fasting and stimulate repair pathways.\n- Sinclair adjusted his regimen over the years, adding spermidine, fisetin, and quercetin to target different cellular pathways and improve his biochemistry.\n- He periodically skips Metformin before days he plans to exercise, mentioning stomach discomfort and potential impacts on exercise benefits.\n- Dr. [Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Sinclair) advises a spermidine supplement company and takes a gram of it as part of his own regimen.\n- For maintenance, he takes half a gram each of fisetin and quercetin daily, which are being studied for their effects on senescent cells in clinical trials.\n\n## Wrap-up and Next Week’s Episode: Interventions on the Cutting Edge [(01:08:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRWT7hVgwuM&t=4131s)\n- The conversation on longevity molecules was recognized as comprehensive but not exhaustive, with a potential for deeper exploration in future episodes.\n- Sinclair emphasizes the importance of consultation with physicians and regular monitoring, such as liver function tests, when trying new supplements or drugs.\n- The next episode of the podcast is set to discuss non-supplement interventions that are considered more cutting-edge, like testosterone, growth hormone, exosomes, and peptides.","## Dr. Peter Attia, Journal Club [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=0s) \n- [Dr. Peter Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia), a health and lifespan expert, collaborates with [Professor Andrew Huberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_D._Huberman) on a journal club episode discussing scientific research papers. \n- They question the conclusions drawn by the researchers and compare them to their own findings.\n- They discuss two papers, one on the possible role of the drug [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) in longevity and the other about the placebo effect in relation to cognitive enhancement.\n- The aim is to provide an insight into how science and medicine are conducted, and encourage listeners to critically examine scientific material on their own.\n\n## Dreams [(00:06:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=371s)\n- The discussion also includes some personal anecdotes and talks about dreaming.\n- They discuss their experiences with vivid and transformative dreams, their impact, and the role of subconscious processes in these experiences.\n- The dream discussion highlights the intersection of scientific investigation, personal experience and personal belief systems. \n- The anecdote about a dream involving a special therapeutic drink and its impact on behaviors and habits in the dream serve to underline Dr. Attia and Professor Huberman's wider discussion on the influences on health outcomes.\n\n## Article #1, Metformin, Mitochondria, Blood Glucose [(00:12:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=756s)\n- The longevity benefits of metformin, a drug used for [type 2 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes) treatment, are highlighted. \n- Metformin tends to inhibit complex one of the mitochondria, which impacts how the body stores energy. \n- Metformin decreases glucose production in the liver, an issue common in type 2 diabetics.\n\n## Type 2 Diabetes & Causes, Insulin Resistance [(00:19:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=1187s)\n- Type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by [insulin resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance) in the muscles. \n- There’s an increase in intramuscular and intracellular fat, that hinders the functioning of insulin, leading to insulin resistance.\n- Insulin resistance means more insulin is needed to transport glucose into the cell. \n- Increasing [insulin resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance) can lead to [type 2 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes). \n- Other factors that cause insulin resistance include energy imbalance, lack of exercise, sleep deprivation, and hypercortisolemia.\n- [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, which helps manage blood glucose levels.\n\n## Type 2 Diabetes Medications, Metformin, Geroprotection, Bannister Study [(00:25:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=1530s)\n- Metformin, a drug for type 2 diabetes, doesn't just increase insulin but rather tackles the problem from another angle by suppressing glucose and addressing the hepatic glucose output channel.\n- Perceptions on Metformin started to shift in 2011, with interest not only in its effect on buffering glucose but also in its potential to be 'geroprotective', that is, offering protection from aging.\n- Geroprotective agents are believed to target hallmarks of aging such as decreased autophagy, increased senescence, defective nutrient sensing, proteomic instability, and genomic instability.\n- In 2014, the Bannister Study found that people with [type 2 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes) on [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) had a crude death rate of 14.4 per thousand patient years versus a control group with 15.2. \n- This finding was surprising because typically, type 2 diabetes reduces life expectancy by six years on average, yet the Metformin group had a slightly better death rate than the non-diabetic group. \n- This led to the theory that Metformin may be doing more than just managing glucose – it may be working as a geroprotective agent by inhibiting mTOR, reducing inflammation, and possibly calming senescent cells and their secretory products.\n- There is still ongoing debate on the geroprotective properties of [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) due to certain constraints and conditions in the Bannister study.\n\n## TAME Trial; Demographics, Twin Cohort [(00:37:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=2235s) \n- Most people consider the banister study as primary evidence for the benefits of metformin.\n- The TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial seeks to ask if metformin's benefits on aging can be established through random assignment.\n- The study referenced utilized half a million subjects from a Danish Health Registry.\n- Two groups were studied: one was a standard replication of what banister did, and the second included discordant twins where only one twin had diabetes.\n- Medicine intake can't be matched in these studies; patients with one health issue taking metformin likely have other health issues, complicating results.\n\n## Metformin & Mortality Rate [(00:44:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=2667s) \n- The study included a sensitivity analysis with and without informative censoring to understand if counting metformin patients who progress matters.\n- The crude mortality rate in each group is given per thousand person years.\n- A notable difference in death rate was observed between people with diabetes and those without.\n- In the study, the death rate among non-diabetic dishcordant twins was around 13 per thousand person years, while for those on metformin with diabetes, it was almost 25 per thousand person years.\n- However, these numbers need to be interpreted considering that these people were not assigned the drug randomly; it's a comparison between people taking metformin to tackle a major health issue and everyone else.\n\n## Kaplan-Meier Mortality Curve, Error Bars & Significance, Statistical Power [(00:51:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=3088s)\n- A [Kaplan-Meyer curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator) is used in all kinds of studies. It is a mortality curve that charts time (x-axis) and cumulative survival (y-axis).\n- Such a curve either goes downwards monotonically or stays flat, it cannot increase.\n- When analyzing a Kaplan-Meyer curve, it is important to understand that there are mathematical representations and error bars that give a sense of range and potential variables.\n- Error bars are used to measure the variability or uncertainty in the data.\n- Even when error bars overlap, it doesn't necessarily denote a significant difference between two treatments—it is dependent on the nature of the experiment.\n- Statistical power is also vital and not discussed as often as it should be. Statistical power is the probability of a test correctly rejecting a null hypothesis.\n- To reduce variability in data, one can increase the sample size. Bigger the sample size, higher is the power of the study to detect the differences.\n- The immense data sets of real-world observational studies make up for limitations and biases as compared to experimental lab studies. Epidemiological studies offer infinite duration and a massive number of subjects, while randomized assignment experiments can control for specific variables but are cost and time prohibitive. Both approaches need to be understood in terms of their inherent strengths and weaknesses.\n\n## Hazard Ratios, Censoring [(01:02:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=3743s)\n- [Hazard ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio), a statistical measurement used in this study, indicate relative harm when the number is greater than one. \n- According to the data presented, those on Metformin exhibited a 48% higher chance of dying annually than their non-diabetic counterparts. \n- When accounting for factors like other medications, marital status, and educational level, the hazard ratio changes but still remains positive, indicating the increased risk of death remains. \n- For the category of twins studied, one with diabetes and one without, the diabetic individual on [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) had a 115% higher chance of dying than their healthy co-twin. \n- The study also took into account censoring, which refers to the practice of excluding Metformin users who have died from the count. This slightly reduced the hazard ratios but did not overturn the general findings. \n\n## Metformin Advantage?, Variables, Interventions Testing Program [(01:09:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=4140s)\n- The presented study found no discernible health advantages offered by Metformin in reversing the disadvantages of having Type 2 diabetes. \n- The data does not confirm whether the subjects taking [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) would have been worse without it, nor does it assert that Metformin doesn't offer some level of protection. \n- These conclusions underline the need for randomized control trials to establish these results accurately. \n- Mentioned also, is the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), funded by NIH for testing molecules for longevity in animal studies. According to it, Metformin failed to provide the expected results. \n- The results were contrasted with other medications like [Rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) and [17 Alpha estradiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17α-Estradiol), which have shown consistent and promising results in animal trials, while [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) has not. \n- Nevertheless, this doesn't definitively rule out possible benefits of Metformin in humans as it was not a human trial.\n\n## Berberine, Acarbose, SGLT2 Inhibitors [(01:16:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=4562s) \n- [Dr. Peter Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) stopped taking metformin five years ago. Metformin is traditionally used for diabetes, but Attia took it for blood glucose buffer and potential longevity.\n- During lactate tests, Attia noticed high lactate levels at rest.\n- According to [Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia), a resting, fasted lactate in a healthy person should be between 0.3.6 millimole. It should only go up when exercising. \n- Using a lactate threshold of two millimoles as a determinant, Attia noticed that his resting lactate was at 1.6 millimole.\n- Applying [berberine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berberine) to a 'slow carb diet' helped to buffer blood glucose and reduce feelings of sickness post high calorie intake.\n- The beneficial effects of berberine were only noticed when taken before a high intake of carbohydrates, otherwise it led to headaches.\n- [Acarbose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acarbose), another glucose disposal drug, showed a survival benefit in the ITP (Interventions Testing Program). Despite the expectation that acarbose would lead to caloric restriction, mice on acarbose lived longer without weighing any less.\n- Speculation suggests that the mice lived longer due to lower glucose and insulin levels.\n- Regular exercise is deemed the best method to keep blood glucose and insulin levels in check.\n- In addition to exercise, a type of drug used for [type 2 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes), [SGLT2 inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGLT2_inhibitor), is taken by Attia due to its promising mechanistic and human trial results.\n\n## Blood Glucose & Energy Balance; Caloric Restriction, Aging Biomarkers [(01:23:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5028s)\n- Buffering blood glucose can be separated from the concept of a caloric deficit. With a balanced energy regime, proper sleep hygiene, extensive exercise, and considerate eating, blood glucose can be controlled without a calorie deficit.\n- The impact of profound caloric restriction on human life-span extension remains uncertain, and most people find it difficult to maintain.\n- Negative energy balance might not necessarily result in a healthier lifestyle if food consumed is primarily unhealthy. \n- Satiety and energy balance can be achieved without focusing too much on macros thanks to unprocessed or minimally processed food sources.\n- The impact of certain anti-aging approaches such as metformin and rapamycin on large populations has not been thoroughly studied.\n- [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin) remains prescribed for patients with insulin resistance, but its efficacy is doubtful for those who are insulin sensitive and exercise frequently.\n- Short periods of caloric restriction may offer benefits in terms of discipline, flexibility, and insulin sensitivity, but there is no sure evidence that it contributes to living longer.\n- The downside of fasting includes profound misery for a few days and unconsciously lost muscle mass which is hard to regain.\n- The field has no concrete biomarkers for aging as of now, thus it is difficult to gauge the success and effectiveness of anti-aging interventions. Invest more resources into finding these biomarkers can lead to a better understanding of aging.\n- Incorporating biomarkers could permit the modification of aging-related interventions and provide more insights about their direction and adequacy.\n\n## Tool: Reading Journal Articles, 4 Questions, Supplemental Information [(01:32:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5542s)\n- An advisable method for understanding complex journal articles is to read and re-read them a number of times; comprehension often improves with each subsequent reading.\n- First-timers approaching a new research paper are encouraged to note down key points like the general and specific research questions being addressed.\n- Understanding the methods used to test these research questions can be beneficial; while fine details aren't always essential, it can be helpful to familiarize oneself with important terminologies or methodologies.\n- Key findings and the paper's conclusions should be noted down; it's helpful to evaluate whether the research findings genuinely support the conclusions presented.\n- While interpreting research papers can be challenging, it's a skill that can be perfected over time given dedication and practice.\n- The reading process often starts with the title and abstract, moving on to the figures and eventually the full text.\n- Many modern research papers incorporate supplementary information not included in the main body of the paper, which might need to be consulted for additional insights.\n  \n## Article #2, Belief Effects vs. Placebo Effect [(01:38:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=5890s)\n- A paper under discussion demonstrates how belief systems about certain drugs influence their impact at both biological and subjective levels.\n- Unlike [placebo effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo), which are either on or off phenomenon, belief effects are influenced by varying degrees of available knowledge.\n- Placebo effects illustrate how individuals can be tricked into believing they are experiencing certain effects based on false information relayed to them.\n- Belief effects, by contrast, suggest that the quality of performance can vary according to our beliefs about stress; if we believe stress enhances performance, we might perform better, and the opposite if we believe it harms performance.\n- These belief effects can either enhance or diminish performance by around 10 to 30 percent.\n- The research showed that belief effects can also impact individuals' sense of satiety and their weight, indicating that beliefs can have significant impacts on physical health.\n\n## Nicotine Effects [(01:45:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=6322s) \n- [Nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine), regardless of the delivery method, can enhance cognitive performance by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of sensory information in the brain. This results in improved clarity of conscious perception.\n- Nicotine binds with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain which enhances signal to noise. This explains why individuals often feel clearer after consuming nicotine. \n- The brain reacts to [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine) by releasing [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) within its reward centers, leading to positive reinforcement and cravings for more nicotine.\n- The intake of nicotine can also stimulate the [ventromedial prefrontal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventromedial_prefrontal_cortex), an area in the brain that enhances focus and attention. This explains the use of substances like Adderall which have similar effects for treating attention deficit disorders.\n- While [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine) can enhance focus, it can also cause muscle relaxation in the peripheral body, explaining its calming effects.\n- It should be noted that while nicotine has these cognitive benefits, its delivery methods and the resulting vasoconstriction can have detrimental health effects.\n\n## Nicotine Doses & Belief Effects, fMRI Scan [(01:51:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=6667s)\n- In the experiment, smokers were given [vape pens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette) with varying doses of nicotine, then observed using functional magnetic resonance imaging ([fMRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging)) to track blood flow patterns in the brain.\n- The fMRI machine measures the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood, visiting active neurons, and observe the changes in blood flow and activity in different brain areas.\n- The subjects in the experiment were also assigned a task designed to engage specific brain areas, including the [thalamus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus), reward pathways, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\n- The task involved observing a market or stock value and predicting if it would rise or fall, earning or losing points accordingly.\n- Subjects were told they were vaping high, medium, or low amounts of [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine), however, they all received the same amount of low nicotine vape.\n- The subject's perceived amount of nicotine influences their feelings, brain activation levels, and performance on the task, creating a belief effect. If subjects were told they received a high amount of [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine), they reported feeling more stimulated and their brain scans showed a higher level of activation.\n- The experiment revealed that what one believes can actually change the brain's response, regardless of the reality of nicotine dosage.\n\n## Biological Effects, Dose-Dependent Response & Belief Effects [(02:00:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7207s)\n- The study mentioned discusses the impact of nicotine and belief effects, indicating that what individuals are told about the dose of a drug changes their physiological responses.\n- Research results indicated a connection between the thalamus and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, a pathway that appeared to be activated according to the perceived dose of [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine).\n- People who believed they had a high dose of nicotine showed a robust activation in this pathway, while low and medium doses resulted in correspondingly lower activations.\n- The findings from this study suggest that one’s belief can bypass pharmacology to a degree, implying that the expected effect of a drug can influence an individual's actual response to it.\n- A missing element in the research was a control group that received zero nicotine, while still being told that they received a high dose of [nicotine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine). \n- This is the first study to analyze the dose-dependence of belief effects helping deepen the understanding of how beliefs can influence pharmacological effects.\n\n## Biology & Beliefs, Significance, Dopamine Response, Non-Smokers [(02:05:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7514s)\n- The degree of activation (beliefs) between the thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed a significant low, medium, and high occurrence of responses.\n- Surprisingly, little nicotinic receptor occupancy in the [thalamus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus) can activate this pathway, and while there was no raw difference detected in its activation, its output was observable.\n- Power and significance differences within the groups were noted and could potentially be statistically significant with a larger sample size.\n- Despite the level of nicotine dose, there was no difference in the activation of reward pathways, suggesting the possibility of leveraging this finding for nicotine quitting strategies.\n- A predicted challenge in conducting a similar experiment with non-smokers is the lack of previous drug experience to compare, which could make them more susceptible to belief effects.\n- A curious side note from the study was the movement artifact caused by smokers coughing during the fMRI scanning process, which could have potentially affected the data's fidelity.\n\n## Dose-Dependence & Beliefs, Side Effects, Nocebo Effect [(02:10:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8c6EyMNd0A&t=7857s)\n- The experiment explores dose dependence of belief, which has implications across a range of drugs, interventions, and vaccines.\n- The effectiveness of some drugs could be influenced by what we believe about them, including their dosage, and how these beliefs affect our brain's reaction to the drugs.\n- Therapeutic effects of drugs such as [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) medication or [GLP-1 agonists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1_receptor_agonist), which impact the hypothalamus that is related to satiety, could potentially be enhanced through the belief effect.\n- Belief effects could potentially influence a patient's response to drugs such as those for treating hypertension. This is still an area for further exploration.\n- The belief about side effects can affect a patient's experience with the drug. If patients are informed that side effects signify that the drug is working, they may tolerate them better and even experience more relief from primary symptoms.\n- Belief effects sometimes manifest as a [nocebo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo), where patients start experiencing all listed side effects after reading about them.\n- There is a need to balance informing patients about possible side effects without instigating a nocebo effect.","## Adenosine in the First 90 Minutes of the Day [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=0s)\n- [Adenosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine), found in the brain and body, accumulates the longer a person is awake and contributes to feelings of sleepiness and fatigue. [(00:00:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=12s)\n- Caffeine blocks [adenosine receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_receptor), preventing drowsiness, but when caffeine wears off, accumulated adenosine can cause a \"crash.\" [(00:01:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=73s)\n- Delaying caffeine intake for 60-90 minutes after waking, while hydrating and getting exposure to bright light, may help clear residual adenosine and promote alertness. [(00:06:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=363s)\n\n## Why Jocko Never Gets Tired [(00:12:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=735s)\n- [Jocko Willink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocko_Willink) participated in a 30-minute sauna session at 225 degrees Fahrenheit. [(00:13:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=788s)\n- Jocko Willink attended a [Cromagnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-Magnon) show after a four-hour podcast, sauna session, and dinner. [(00:14:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=849s)\n- There is a genetic mutation that allows some people to only need 3-5 hours of sleep per night. [(00:14:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=880s)\n\n## How to Become a Morning Person [(00:23:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=1439s)\n- It takes approximately three days to shift biological mechanisms to become a [morning person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark_(person)). [(00:24:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=1451s)\n- The four primary zeitgebers, or timekeepers, that can shift the [circadian clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_clock) are: viewing bright light in the morning, exercise or movement, caffeine, and social interaction. [(00:25:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=1521s)\n- Viewing sunlight in the afternoon, even for five minutes, can adjust the sensitivity of the retina so that bright light at night does not suppress melatonin as much. [(00:30:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=1834s)\n\n## Andrew’s New Daily Routine [(00:35:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=2105s)\n- The speaker divides their day into three blocks: 6 a.m. to noon, noon to 6 p.m., and 6 p.m. to bedtime. [(00:36:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=2185s)\n- The speaker finds that they are most productive when they exercise early in the day, between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m.. [(00:36:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=2207s)\n- The speaker's ideal schedule involves intense work in the first two blocks of the day, with social time and relaxation in the evening.

[(00:44:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=2647s)\n- To navigate the election cycle, it is suggested to pay attention to the dominance language used by candidates, specifically focusing on whether they are expressing their true beliefs or telling people what they want to hear. [(00:46:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=2791s)\n- It is argued that people are more likely to vote for a candidate who expresses their beliefs with conviction, regardless of whether they agree with those beliefs, as it conveys authenticity and a clear vision for the future. [(00:48:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=2913s)\n\n## Why Stories Are More Powerful Than Statistics [(00:53:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=3226s)\n- People's beliefs are more strongly influenced by stories than statistics. [(00:54:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=3250s)\n- The brain stores memories in a beginning, middle, and end structure, similar to how stories are structured. [(00:54:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=3274s)\n- Flashbulb memories, which are vivid and detailed memories of emotionally significant events, are an exception to the beginning, middle, and end memory structure. [(00:56:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=3362s)\n\n## The Tim Kennedy Alarm Clock [(01:04:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=3886s)\n- [Tim Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Kennedy_(fighter)) has acute vision and can spot potential threats from a distance.

[(01:06:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=4016s)\n- Waking up to a troubling text message triggers adrenaline, similar to how a traumatic experience can create a conditioned response to certain stimuli. [(01:07:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=4047s)\n\n## Dissecting the Story You Tell Yourself [(01:09:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=4195s)\n- Trauma can re-pattern old memories, potentially leading individuals to reinterpret past feelings and experiences. [(01:10:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=4254s)\n- It is important to acknowledge emotions, examine personal motivations, and challenge unspoken assumptions about the world. [(01:11:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=4317s)\n- Reframing experiences to focus on enjoyment during the process of improvement, rather than postponing happiness for a future outcome, can be a powerful tool. [(01:19:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=4783s)\n\n## The Blessing & Curse of Good Memory [(01:21:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=4888s)\n- The speaker has a very good memory, being able to recall conversations and events from their early childhood. [(01:21:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=4888s)\n- The speaker experienced a shift in their cognition, transitioning from being drawn to past memories to a present-focused mindset.

[(01:25:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=5110s)\n\n## How Andrew Deals With Public Scrutiny [(01:31:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=5508s)\n- It was discovered that media often contains falsehoods, including fabricated stories and narratives spun from a lack of context or outright lies. [(01:33:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=5612s)\n- It was observed that podcasting, unlike traditional media, allows for authenticity and genuine expression, with podcast hosts like [Joe Rogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan), [Lex Fridman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Fridman), and others being themselves and not conforming to external pressures. [(01:37:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=5846s)\n- A parallel was drawn between the evolution of media, from game shows as a means to sell products to reality TV and social media as platforms for self-casting, with podcasts emerging as a space for genuine human connection and interaction. [(01:40:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=6016s)\n\n## What it Was Like to Wake Up to the Hit Piece [(01:42:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=6173s)\n- A committee of trusted individuals, including family, friends, and colleagues, provided support and guidance during a challenging period. [(01:43:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=6227s)\n- Despite personal attacks and attempts to discredit his past, support from individuals familiar with his background, including those from the skateboarding community, reinforced the truthfulness of his experiences. [(01:46:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=6391s)\n- Prayer became a source of grounding, clarity, and guidance, helping to navigate the situation and make decisions aligned with personal values. [(01:52:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=6742s)\n\n## Advice to People Going Through an Intense Time [(01:55:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=6928s)\n- Building a strong support network during good times is crucial, as it will be there for you during challenging times. [(01:56:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=6991s)\n- Utilizing tools and strategies for stress management, such as sleep, breathing exercises, and hot-cold therapy, is essential for navigating difficult periods. [(01:57:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=7023s)\n- Seeking support from others, whether through personal connections, books, podcasts, or faith, can provide guidance and perspective during times of crisis. [(01:59:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=7183s)\n\n## The Lonely Chapter [(02:04:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=7490s)\n- The “lonely chapter” is a period of time in which an individual is growing and changing as a person. [(02:04:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=7497s)\n- During this period, an individual may feel isolated as they are no longer able to resonate with their old friends, but have not yet developed new friendships. [(02:05:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=7506s)\n- The speaker believes that everyone who decides to make a significant change in their life will experience the lonely chapter. [(02:06:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=7561s)\n\n## Thoughts on Bryan Johnson [(02:14:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=8068s)\n- [Bryan Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) is exploring the field of longevity in a unique way. [(02:14:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=8084s)\n- There are many different perspectives on health and science, and it is important to consider all of them. [(02:16:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=8160s)\n- It is crucial to be able to filter the vast amount of information available and focus on practices that have stood the test of time and can be enhanced by technology. [(02:18:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=8336s)\n\n## Current State of Longevity Research [(02:20:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=8450s)\n- Rapamycin (Rapa), a drug that mimics fasting and potentially extends lifespan, has limited human data and may cause side effects like reduced testosterone and libido. [(02:21:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=8508s)\n- Sublingual NMN, a precursor to [NAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide), has been anecdotally linked to hair and nail growth, as well as increased morning energy, but more research is needed. [(02:24:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=8653s)\n- Excessive stress, lack of sleep, and a lack of joy can negatively impact longevity, while moderate exercise, a balanced lifestyle, and stress management are beneficial. [(02:26:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=8764s)\n\n## Thinking About Your Long Arc [(02:32:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=9120s)\n- It is important to develop the skill to say no to things, even things that you may have dreamt of doing, as opportunities arise. [(02:34:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=9245s)\n- Avoiding catastrophic events is more beneficial than trying to expedite success. [(02:40:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=9636s)\n- It is important to take care of your health and well-being, but even with the best efforts, unforeseen events can happen. [(02:41:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=9701s)\n\n## Using BPC-157 to Recover Faster [(02:44:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=9858s)\n- [BPC-157](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPC-157) should only be obtained through a compounding pharmacy with a doctor's prescription due to the prevalence of contaminated versions. [(02:44:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=9873s)\n- BPC-157 can accelerate healing from injuries, but continuous use is not recommended. [(02:44:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=9892s)\n- BPC-157's mechanism of action involves detecting injuries and promoting the activity of fibroblasts, cells involved in tissue repair, particularly in tendons. [(02:48:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10104s)\n\n## Why Andrew is Teaching an Undergraduate Course [(02:53:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10410s)\n- The course will have 400-600 students and will include guest lectures. [(02:54:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10492s)\n- The course will be taught in a large lecture format and will involve reading and evaluating papers. [(02:55:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10524s)\n- The course curriculum is being designed with the help of 6-8 student TAs. [(02:55:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10533s)\n\n## Being a Researcher & Influencer [(02:57:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10667s)\n- A shift occurred in 2019 and 2020 towards creating online content and participating in podcasts. [(02:58:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10686s)\n- Currently, research is focused on human clinical trials, including remote studies on stress mitigation and investigations into non-sleep deep rest and visual repair. [(02:59:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10742s)\n- A significant effort is being made to secure funding for research, including raising awareness, obtaining donations, and advocating for increased government support. [(03:02:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=10970s)\n\n## How to Follow Your Intuition More [(03:06:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=11198s)\n- The nervous system, including the brain and body, plays a crucial role in intuition, acting as a guide in our awareness. [(03:07:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=11274s)\n- Engaging in exercises like visualizing extremely positive and negative scenarios can help individuals tap into their intuition and recognize their body's responses to different stimuli. [(03:08:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=11317s)\n- Intuition, similar to the rod system in the retina, is highly sensitive but may lack detailed information, while logical thinking, like the cone system, provides more specific details but is less sensitive. [(03:12:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=11556s)\n\n## What’s Next for Andrew [(03:24:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=12281s)\n- There is interest in creating content for children, potentially involving animation and puppets. [(03:25:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=12300s)\n- Outreach has been made to puppeteers and animators, but plans are not finalized. [(03:25:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=12317s)\n- Gratitude is expressed for the opportunity to appear on the platform and for the host's work. [(03:26:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbXjK-F-5so&t=12361s)","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=0s)\n- [Bryan Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) changed his life to reverse his age and increase his lifespan.\n- He is curious about how his ideas and theories on longevity have changed over the last decade.\n## 30% Off Your First Order AND a Free Gift Worth up to $60 [(00:00:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=27s)\n- Thrive Market is an online membership-based [grocery

other harmful ingredients.\n- Use the link in the description to get 30% off your entire grocery order and a free $60 gift with any purchase.\n## Nighttime Er*ctions [(00:01:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=74s)\n- [Bryan Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) noticed an increase in nighttime erections after undergoing electromagnetic shock therapy and targeted muscle strengthening.\n- Nighttime erections are a significant indicator of biological age, sexual function, and psychological health.\n- A device called the Cube Squared was used to measure the duration and quality of nighttime erections.\n- Initially, Johnson's nighttime erections lasted for 132 minutes, which was within the normal range for his chronological age of 46.\n- After undergoing focused shock wave therapy and [Botox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin) injections in the penis, Johnson's nighttime erections increased to 179 minutes, surpassing the average duration for 18-year-olds.\n- Nighttime erections tend to peak between the ages of 20 and 29, with an average duration of around 165 minutes.\n- There is a significant drop in nighttime erection duration between the ages of 45 and 49.\n## If One is Good, Two Must be Better [(00:05:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=336s)\n- [Bryan Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) changed his mind on the idea that \"if one is good, two must be better\".\n- He found that taking two drops of liquid iodine per day, instead of the recommended one drop, put him outside the reference range for a certain marker.\n- He learned that \"two is not better\" and that the most precise amount should be found and followed.\n- Taking more than the recommended amount of a supplement can have detrimental effects.\n- The goal is to find the minimum effective dose for everything.\n## Increasing Therapies to Reversing Aging [(00:08:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=496s)\n- [Bryan Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson)'s speed of aging was measured using DNA methylation patterns.\n- Certain therapies increased his speed of aging, including a senolytic profile of daip and curs, and HGH therapy to rejuvenate his thymus.\n- After discontinuing these therapies, his speed of aging returned to baseline.\n- There is a trade-off in therapies, not all things are universally good, some have negative consequences.\n- Bryan Johnson's speed of aging dropped to his lowest ever, 64, which is exceptionally low for a 46-year-old.\n- Only two therapies may have caused this lowering: a peptide regimen and Festa gene therapy.\n- It is unclear which therapy was responsible for the improvement.\n## Bryan's Experience with Peptides [(00:12:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=728s)\n- Tried CJC and pamaran peptides.\n- Negative side effects: wrecked [sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep) for two days, even at a reduced dose.\n- Discontinuing peptide use due to these side effects.\n- No longer taking metformin.\n- Reduced rapamycin dose to once per week.\n- Added methylene blue and [NAD+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) to his regimen.\n- Continuing with other supplements like [CoQ10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10), [PQQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrroloquinoline_quinone), and fish oil.\n## The Importance of Sleep (most important thing) [(00:12:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=772s)\n- [Bryan Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) has revised his extreme longevity protocols, prioritizing [sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep) as the most crucial factor in his overall health and well-being.\n- He emphasizes the significance of optimal sleep for intellectual performance, particularly when tackling complex problems and contemplating the future of intelligent existence.\n- Johnson believes that sleep deprivation severely impairs clear thinking and mental clarity.\n- His ideal sleep routine involves creating a blackout environment, utilizing white noise, and waking up naturally without an alarm.\n- After experiencing sleep disruption due to his son's frequent nighttime wake-ups, Johnson realized the profound impact of sleep on his health and well-being.\n- He now focuses on maintaining a resting heart rate of 47 bpm as an objective indicator of good sleep quality.\n- [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) stresses the importance of valuing [sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep) and investing emotional significance in it to maximize its benefits.\n- He avoids making crucial life decisions during periods of poor sleep, recognizing its detrimental effects on his mental and emotional state.\n- To enhance sleep quality, Johnson practices a \"sleep divorce\" from his wife, sleeping in separate rooms to minimize disturbances.\n- He also recommends maintaining a comfortable bedroom temperature, around 73 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and 67 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer.\n## Setting Our Sights on Conquering Death [(00:22:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=1370s)\n- Bryan Johnson believes it is the right time to set our sights on conquering death.\n- He thinks we can meaningfully change how we think about aging, deterioration, rejuvenation, and life extension.\n- [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) doesn't claim to have solved immortality but believes we can change the game of decay and death.\n- He suggests that this should become the singular game for humanity, individually, collectively, and for AI.\n- Johnson acknowledges that we may not achieve immortality but wants to prolong life with a good quality of life.\n- He compares the human body to a Toyota Camry that will eventually break down but can be maintained to extend its lifespan.\n## Where to Find More of Bryan's Content [(00:25:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt-2UYS-qNc&t=1510s)\n- Bryan Johnson's website is [blueprint.brianjohnson.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint).","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=0s)\n- Brian [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson) embodies his practice of reversing the aging process.\n- The video discusses his daily diet and longevity protocol.\n## Diet [(00:01:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=82s)\n- [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson)'s daily diet is designed to nourish and optimize the function of every organ in his body.\n- His breakfast consists of a super veggie dish made with broccoli, cauliflower, lentils, hemp seeds, garlic, and ginger.\n- The next meal is a nutty pudding made with macadamia nuts, walnuts, flax seed, sunflower lopin, pomegranate juice, berries, and pea protein.\n- The final meal of the day is berries, nuts, and seeds of some variety.\n- [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson) also consumes 45 mL of extra virgin olive oil per day, divided between his meals.\n- He follows a compressed eating window, starting his first meal around 4:00 or 5:00 AM and finishing by 11:00 AM.\n## 30% Off Your First Order AND a Free Gift Worth up to $60 [(00:02:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=135s)\n- Thrive Market is an online membership-based grocery store offering a 30% discount and a $60 free gift for new customers using a special link.\n- Thomas DeLauer has created low-carb keto truffles and nut butters sweetened with allulose, available on Thrive Market.\n## Sleep [(00:03:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=193s)\n- __Bryan [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson)__ optimizes his sleep by maintaining a low resting heart rate before bedtime and ensuring consistent [REM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep) and deep sleep stages.\n- Deviations from ideal sleep habits, dietary changes, and stress can disrupt his sleep patterns.\n- To manage stress, Johnson employs a technique where he treats different aspects of his mind as separate \"Brians,\" allowing him to compartmentalize his thoughts and emotions.\n- Johnson emphasizes the importance of hydration for longevity and overall health.\n## Hydration [(00:08:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=537s)\n- Bryan Johnson tries to consume around 60 to 100 ounces of water a day, all before 4 p.m.\n- He mineralizes all his water with tea or electrolytes to aid absorption.\n- He found that drinking around 1600 ounces of mineralized water daily keeps him hydrated without needing to wake up at night to use the bathroom.\n- Overhydration is as easy as underhydration and can lead to demineralization.\n- The most grandiose thing __Bryan [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson)__ has spent money on for longevity and reversing epigenetic age is not the project itself, but the cost of measuring his molecular health (MH).\n## Testing [(00:11:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=674s)\n- $2 million per year is spent on research, not on Bryan Johnson's body.\n- The money was spent on evaluating scientific literature on health and lifespan, ranking interventions based on their power, and measuring the effects of implementing these interventions on Bryan Johnson.\n- The majority of the money has gone into research and figuring out how to implement esoteric therapies.\n- The basics of Bryan Johnson's protocol, which most people can follow, cost around $1500 per month including groceries.\n- Six categories contribute to an estimated life expectancy of 92 years:\n - Don't smoke (adds 12 years)\n - Exercise 6 hours per week\n - Follow a Mediterranean or Blueprint diet\n - Maintain a [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) between 18.5 and 22.5\n - Moderate to zero alcohol consumption\n - Prioritize sleep\n- Each category is weighted slightly differently in the overall score.\n- Overdoing exercise (more than 6 hours per week) may have a negative impact on the overall score.\n- Different types of exercise can be combined as long as the total amount of exercise meets the recommended guidelines.\n- __Bryan [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson)__ incorporates red light therapy into his morning routine.\n## Light Exposure [(00:14:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=849s)\n- Bryan Johnson's daily routine involves morning sunlight exposure before 9 or 10 am and evening exposure after 5 or 6 pm, avoiding peak UV hours.\n- To minimize blue light exposure, he uses blue light-blocking glasses and avoids screen time before bed.\n- Johnson incorporates red and near-infrared light therapy three times a week for 12 minutes.\n- He follows a strict diet, avoiding processed foods, sugar, and soda, and focuses on a plant-based diet with limited animal products.\n- [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson)'s longevity protocol aims to extend his lifespan to 120+ years, prioritizing time efficiency and measuring various health markers, including antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress.\n- He acknowledges the complexity of health and wellness and the lack of consensus among experts, emphasizing the importance of identifying and tracking key markers with evidence-based support for longevity.\n- Some basic markers he monitors include sleep quality, heart rate variability, and blood glucose levels.\n## Biomarkers [(00:21:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=1295s)\n- Excessive inflammation is considered bad, while low inflammation is considered good.\n- Blood glucose levels should be monitored and kept within a healthy range.\n- Cholesterol levels are debatable, with no clear consensus on what is considered healthy.\n- Basic biochemistry of the body, such as white blood cell and red blood cell counts, are important indicators of health.\n## Bryan Johnson’s Daily Diet and Longevity Protocol [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=0s)\n- __Bryan [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson)__ shares his daily diet and longevity protocol, which has helped him achieve top percentiles in various health markers.\n- He emphasizes that his approach is not necessarily the best or the only way to achieve health and wellness, but it provides a starting point for individuals to improve their health.\n- The first step in his journey was to adopt a holistic approach to health, considering all aspects of his lifestyle, including diet, exercise, and mental well-being.\n## Biological Age [(00:24:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=1452s)\n- Sleep onset (time it takes to fall asleep) and wake after sleep onset (how much you're up for the night) are age markers.\n- Ideal sleep onset is under 4 minutes and wake after sleep onset should be under 30 minutes.\n- As people age, their sleep duration tends to decrease.\n- The pineal gland helps with melatonin and sleep, but it can calcify over time, leading to decreased sleep quality.\n- There's a theory that ultrasound can be used to decalcify the pineal gland and improve sleep.\n- As biological systems age, it becomes harder to fall asleep and stay asleep.\n- Competing systems, such as an enlarged prostate, can further disrupt sleep.\n- The calcification of the pineal gland may be accelerated by stress or neuroinflammation.\n- Technology allows us to measure body parts and their functions with greater precision, leading to more targeted and effective health interventions.\n- Used to take 111 supplements a day.\n## Supplements [(00:28:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=1704s)\n- __Bryan [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson)__'s daily diet and longevity protocol aim to extend his lifespan to 120+ years.\n- He reduced his supplement intake from over 40 to 42 and now manufactures his own food and supplements.\n- Extra virgin olive oil (EVO) is a crucial component of his diet, offering benefits such as reduced oxidative stress, LDL cholesterol, and blood glucose.\n- Johnson practices intermittent fasting, stopping eating around 11:00 a.m. and maintaining a low carbohydrate intake while preserving lean body mass.\n- He produces between half and one millimole of ketones by the end of the day, even during intense training, and believes metabolic instability occurs when people constantly fuel their bodies without allowing ketone production.\n- Ketones provide anti-inflammatory and cardiometabolic protective benefits.\n- [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson) [rem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep)ains open to learning and measuring his ketone levels to optimize his longevity protocol.\n## Where to Find More of Bryan's Content [(00:34:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUrtUDg6v8&t=2078s)\n- Bryan [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Johnson)'s products and the

[(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=0s)\n- It seems unusual that many people in the health and fitness industry are now focusing on longevity. [(00:00:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=3s)\n- It is difficult to be an expert on longevity as few people live past 100 years old. [(00:00:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=14s)\n- There is a lot of misinformation about longevity online. [(00:00:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=27s)\n\n## 30% Off Your First Order AND a Free Gift Worth up to $60 [(00:00:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=32s)\n- Thrive Market is an online membership-based [grocery store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store) that offers lower-sugar and healthier processed food options.

[(00:01:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=72s)\n\n## Why Longevity Studies Can Be Difficult to Interpret [(00:01:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=96s)\n- Longevity studies are often based on epidemiology and [cohort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)) studies because conducting randomized controlled trials over an extensive period is impractical. [(00:01:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=107s)\n- Cohort studies involve tracking a group of individuals over a defined period to observe the incidence of specific outcomes and identify associated traits, but these studies can be influenced by healthy user bias, where individuals with one healthy habit tend to have others, making it challenging to isolate the impact of individual factors. [(00:02:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=160s)\n- Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for evidence because they involve randomly assigning participants to different intervention groups, ensuring that inherent characteristics are distributed evenly and that observed outcomes are more likely due to the treatment rather than pre-existing factors. [(00:05:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=304s)\n\n## Fasting & Caloric Restriction [(00:07:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=442s)\n- Fasting may be beneficial for longevity, but its benefits for weight control are not unique. Studies on fasting and longevity are limited, with only a few conducted on mice and other organisms like yeast. [(00:07:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=443s)\n- Rodents are not an ideal model for studying longevity because, unlike primates and humans, they experience continuous growth throughout their lifespan. [(00:09:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=551s)\n- Calorie restriction studies, particularly those in primates, suggest that maintaining a normal or lean body weight, rather than severe calorie restriction, is likely responsible for observed longevity benefits. [652]\n\n## Proven Ways to Optimize for Longevity [(00:11:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=700s)\n- To optimize longevity, maintain a healthy body weight, ideally within the 15-20% body fat range. [(00:12:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0M-0Yk27fg&t=762s)\n- Engaging in regular exercise, regardless of body weight, offers numerous health benefits, including reducing mortality risk and lowering the chances of developing cardiovascular disease and cancer.

burdensome, prioritizing habit formation and simple daily procedures.\n- Addresses concerns over sexual side effects from hair loss medications by adjusting dosages and monitoring libido.\n- Uses a high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation device to improve pelvic health and inadvertently noted an increase in nocturnal erections.\n\n## The importance of posture [(01:28:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yfoonW1InE&t=5329s)\n- [Bryan Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) emphasizes posture due to its impact on blood flow and brain health.\n- He discovered he has narrow internal jugular veins, affecting blood flow from the brain.\n- Poor posture can exacerbate intracranial pressure, adversely affecting the brain.\n- Measurements revealed high intracranial pressure and white matter hyperintensities in his brain.\n- His team focused on posture to alleviate these issues and prevent potential catastrophic events.\n- He mentions the difficulty in maintaining good posture and its potential link to health outcomes.\n\n## How we can use AI to enhance our health [(01:33:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yfoonW1InE&t=5583s)\n- Bryan discusses the necessity of aligning with AI, using a thought experiment on future perspectives.\n- He speculates that a 25th-century [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) might observe the principle of preserving life, reflecting how our current actions may influence it.\n- The cooperation between all forms of intelligence is seen as essential for survival.\n- He suggests that humans need to adopt a singular goal of existence to coexist with AI.\n- Bryan challenges the cultural acceptance of death and promotes proactive efforts to extend life.\n- He suggests rethinking authority structures and prioritizing life over competing human desires.\n- There is a consideration for control systems beyond human capacity for long-term survival.\n- [Bryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) talks about the usual counterargument against extreme life preservation measures and questions the supremacy of the human mind over the body.\n\n## Why your mind needs to stop making the decisions [(01:43:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yfoonW1InE&t=6213s)\n- [Bryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) Johnson believes that individuals must strive to eliminate self-violence and internal conflicts.\n- He foresees artificial intelligence as the new dominating force on the planet, superseding human intelligence.\n- Johnson views the challenge of our time as the need for cooperation and harmony, both individually and at the species level.\n- He's focused on solving broader existential threats personally—such as climate change, AI alignment, and social cooperation.\n- In developing his philosophy, he aims to be a one-person example of solving complex system problems, a concept he refers to as \"blueprint.\"\n- Johnson does not feel optimistic about the human mind solving these issues alone, hence the urgency in his work.\n- He believes we have less time than expected to counter existential threats and that proactive measures should be taken immediately without waiting for potential catastrophe.\n\n## You think differently [(01:49:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yfoonW1InE&t=6592s)\n- [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) acknowledges he thinks differently compared to others, citing neurological divergence.\n- He perceives the world as generally illogical and is often surprised at how different his viewpoint is from the majority.\n- There is mutual sentiment, as the world views him as unusual, but he believes the societal status quo is more peculiar and irrational.\n\n## The most important thing people need to know [(01:51:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yfoonW1InE&t=6680s)\n- The essential message from Johnson is that humanity has a unique opportunity to evolve and experience extraordinary existence.\n- Significant sacrifice and a paradigm shift from sacred societal beliefs will be necessary for this evolution.\n- He emphasizes internal revolution through daily self-care acts such as proper sleep, healthy eating, avoiding addictions, and responsible engagement with technology.\n- Johnson promotes the importance of personal responsibility and action rather than attributing blame externally for societal issues.\n- He exudes a sense of satisfaction from dedicating his life to identifying and promoting a philosophy that could potentially benefit humanity.\n\n## Are you misunderstood? [(01:54:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yfoonW1InE&t=6893s)\n- Brian [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson) is often labeled as narcissistic and self-centered because of his attempts to reverse aging.\n- The public perception of Johnson as seeking eternal youth for selfish reasons, such as dating younger people, differs from the reality of his motivations.\n- Johnson's actual goal is more focused on advancing human well-being rather than personal gain.\n- He cares deeply for his family and is trying to improve their health and longevity.\n- [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson)'s father, at 75, has been a particular concern for him, as he has faced the fear of losing him to death.\n- He actively sends his parents health supplements and advice to help prolong their lives, though they sometimes find it overwhelming.\n- The interviewer acknowledges the value in Johnson's unique perspective and his atypical way of thinking.\n- It is important to have diverse thinkers in society, as they bring innovation and new perspectives that can benefit human progress.\n- Despite societal pressures and judgments, Johnson remains committed to his mission.\n- The interviewer expresses respect for [Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Johnson)'s courage to ignore criticism and pursue his path.\n- Both the interviewer and Johnson appreciate the open, non-judgmental dialogue they shared during the conversation.\n- Johnson's experiences with close-mindedness in interviews have made the understanding and open-minded approach of the interviewer particularly meaningful to him.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=0s)\n- This video will discuss 25 simple strategies for increasing longevity and enhancing overall health. [(00:00:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1s)\n- The video will include information relevant to fat loss because maintaining lower body fat levels is a significant factor in promoting a longer and healthier life, according to longevity experts. [(00:00:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=27s)\n- The video will primarily focus on positive actions and habits rather than restrictive rules. [(00:00:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=50s)\n\n## Priorities for Longevity [(00:01:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=61s)\n- Sustainability and mental well-being are crucial for any lifestyle changes aimed at longevity. [(00:01:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=63s)\n- Relationships are considered the most important factor for longevity, serving as a foundation for other health aspects. [(00:01:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=73s)\n- While other factors contribute to longevity, their impact is significantly enhanced when mental health and strong relationships are prioritized. [(00:01:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=87s)\n\n## NEAT [(00:01:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=101s)\n- Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) burns significantly more calories than dedicated workouts, potentially close to 1,000 calories depending on the individual. [(00:02:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=121s)\n- While workouts typically burn between 200 to 800 calories per hour, NEAT can contribute significantly more calorie expenditure throughout the day. [(00:02:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=135s)\n- The body may subconsciously downregulate activity levels following intense exercise, leading to reduced fidgeting and movement, making NEAT a more sustainable approach to calorie expenditure. [(00:02:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=157s)\n\n## Nutrient Quality First, Calories Second [(00:03:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=190s)\n- Calories are important to keep in mind, but nutrient quality should be prioritized. [(00:03:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=198s)\n- When individuals consume nutrient-rich foods, they are more likely to feel satiated and less likely to overeat. [(00:03:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=211s)\n- An excessive focus on calorie counting can be detrimental, as it can lead to a constant battle against hunger, which is a losing proposition. [(00:04:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=245s)\n\n## Be Cognizant of Insulin [(00:04:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=272s)\n- Insulin should not be feared, but it is important to be aware of its effects on metabolic health. [(00:05:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=322s)\n- Consistently high insulin levels are detrimental to metabolic health. [(00:04:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=297s)\n- [Insulin resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance) is a global issue and the largest disease worldwide. [(00:05:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=338s)\n\n## Minerals are the Life Force [(00:06:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=363s)\n- Minerals are essential for human health and should be prioritized over vitamin supplementation. [(00:06:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=373s)\n- Modern diets are becoming increasingly deficient in minerals, making supplementation potentially necessary. [(00:06:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=392s)\n- Magnesium is particularly important, playing a vital role in hydration and overall well-being. [(00:06:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=401s)\n\n## Protein First [(00:06:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=413s)\n- It is important to prioritize protein intake regardless of caloric intake, especially when in a caloric deficit. [(00:06:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=414s)\n- Sacrificing protein and losing muscle mass is detrimental to longevity. [(00:07:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=424s)\n- Building and maintaining lean muscle mass and high protein intake early in life is crucial. [(00:07:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=438s)\n\n## Prioritize GLP-1 [(00:07:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=449s)\n- [GLP-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLP-1_receptor_agonist) can be stimulated naturally through diet, which is not comparable to taking pharmaceutical GLP-1 drugs. [(00:07:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=474s)\n- Ways to increase GLP-1 levels include increasing fiber and monounsaturated fat intake, decreasing polyunsaturated fat intake, and consuming allulose. [(00:08:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=486s)\n- Researching foods that stimulate GLP-1 is recommended. [(00:08:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=515s)\n\n## Deep, Leafy Greens [(00:08:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=527s)\n- Sulforaphane, found in broccoli, is a powerful compound beneficial to one's diet. [(00:08:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=535s)\n- Spinach should be consumed in moderation due to its oxalate content, but other leafy greens like arugula and low-oxalate options are available. [(00:09:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=545s)\n- While some greens contain high levels of oxalate, not all greens are detrimental to health. [(00:09:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=551s)\n\n## View Calories Over the Course of a Week [(00:09:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=564s)\n- It is more beneficial to focus on weekly calorie intake rather than daily intake. [(00:09:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=572s)\n- A weekly calorie deficit, even a small one, is a key factor in achieving positive results. [(00:09:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=584s)\n- Shifting between periods of higher and lower calorie intake within a week can be beneficial for body composition and metabolic rate. [(00:09:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=592s)\n\n## Occasional Longer Fasts [(00:10:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=604s)\n- Studies examining the difference between intermittent fasting and caloric restriction often focus on short-term fasts, typically lasting 12 to 16 hours. [(00:10:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=618s)\n- Longer fasts, exceeding 24 hours, have demonstrated significant metabolic, caloric restriction, and longevity benefits, particularly in rodent studies. [(00:10:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=637s)\n- Occasional longer fasts, lasting 24 to 36 hours, conducted every few months, can be beneficial for most individuals. [(00:11:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=660s)\n\n## Become Fat Adapted [(00:11:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=678s)\n- Most people primarily use carbohydrates as their fuel source, leading to a reduced ability to process fats efficiently. [(00:11:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=693s)\n- By occasionally limiting carbohydrate intake, such as skipping carbohydrates in meals or training in a fasted state, the body can become conditioned to utilize fat reserves more effectively. [(00:12:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=737s)\n- This process, known as becoming \"fat adapted,\" allows the body to better utilize stored fat for energy when carbohydrates are less available. [(00:12:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=761s)\n\n## Dairy Fat is a Health Food [(00:12:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=767s)\n- Red meat is not necessarily problematic for health; rather, it is processed meats that pose a greater concern. [(00:12:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=777s)\n- Dairy fat, particularly the conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) found in it, has been linked to both cardiovascular health and fat loss. [(00:13:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=788s)\n- Instead of consuming large amounts of heavy cream or half-and-half, consider using dairy fat strategically, similar to a supplement, opting for high-quality aged cheeses like [Pecorino Romano.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino_romano) [(00:13:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=803s)\n\n## 30% Off Your First Order AND a Free Gift Worth up to $60 [(00:13:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=837s)\n- Thrive Market is an online grocery store that offers a variety of \"better for you\" options.

[(00:14:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=862s)\n- Thrive Market allows users to search for specific dietary needs and food types, making healthy shopping easier and more affordable. [(00:14:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=877s)\n\n## Misogi [(00:15:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=905s)\n- [Misogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogi) is a [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language) tradition of engaging in a mentally and/or physically demanding activity annually to purify the mind, body, and spirit. [(00:15:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=906s)\n- This practice can involve activities such as climbing a mountain or meditating for an extended period, pushing oneself to their limits. [(00:15:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=942s)\n- The concept of Misogi originated from ancient samurai traditions, where individuals would sit under waterfalls to cleanse themselves, symbolizing a reset in life. [(00:15:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=956s)\n\n## Prioritize Sleep [(00:16:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=982s)\n- Obsessing over sleep can be counterproductive, and prioritizing and establishing a consistent sleep schedule can lead to improvements. [(00:16:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=991s)\n- Humans are naturally capable of sleep, and adhering to basic sleep hygiene principles, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding late-night meals, and incorporating a wind-down routine, can promote better sleep. [(00:16:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1013s)\n- Creating sleep pressure by engaging in physical activity and avoiding excessive sedentary behavior is crucial, as it increases the body's need for sleep. [(00:17:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1028s)\n\n## G-Flux [(00:17:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1059s)\n- It is more beneficial to consume a larger amount of calories and engage in increased physical activity compared to consuming fewer calories and being less active. [(00:17:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1061s)\n- Even with calorie restriction and increased exercise, calorie expenditure is less efficient due to a lowered metabolic rate. [(00:17:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1070s)\n- Maintaining a higher level of energy expenditure through increased food intake and physical activity, while keeping the net calorie deficit consistent, is more effective for boosting metabolism. [(00:17:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1075s)\n\n## Be Cognizant of Oxalates [(00:18:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1088s)\n- Oxalates are naturally produced by the body but cannot be broken down. [(00:18:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1091s)\n- Oxalates can accumulate in the kidneys, blood, and joints, potentially leading to health issues. [(00:18:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1106s)\n- It is advisable to moderate the consumption of high-oxalate foods and explore alternative options. [(00:18:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1119s)\n\n## Don't Fear Caffeine [(00:18:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1130s)\n- Studies show that people who consume caffeine are less frail, possibly due to increased activity levels. [(00:18:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFHWkdgqbok&t=1133s)\n- It is preferable to consume caffeine from natural sources like green tea and coffee, as they contain beneficial antioxidants and other compounds.

[American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) healthcare system is complex, multi-payer, and commercial, leading to high costs and unexpected medical bills.\n- High medical costs are a significant financial burden for many Americans, especially those who are underinsured or uninsured.\n- Despite having some of the best medical care in the world, the US healthcare system lacks a comprehensive social safety net, leaving many people without access to affordable healthcare.\n- The people most affected by the high costs of healthcare are not necessarily the poorest, but those who are underinsured or cannot afford health insurance despite having jobs and other expenses.\n- Preventative interventions to extend lifespan and healthspan lack insurance reimbursement codes, and current medicine focuses on fixing problems after they occur rather than preventing them.\n## How to Improve Mental Cognition [(00:05:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=347s)\n- To

strategies.\n## Peter’s Opinion on TRT [(01:05:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=3954s)\n- Testosterone replacement therapy ([TRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_replacement_therapy)) is generally safe when used correctly under medical supervision.\n- There is no evidence that TRT increases the risk of prostate cancer, and some evidence suggests it may decrease the risk.\n- The data on the relationship between TRT and cardiovascular disease is mixed, but overall, it does not appear to increase the risk.\n- TRT should be used cautiously in young men due to potential risks to fertility and other unknown long-term effects.\n- High doses of testosterone can cause an increase in estrogen and [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone), leading to the use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and aromatase inhibitors, which have potential side effects.\n- Prolonged use of TRT, especially in younger individuals, can result in permanent infertility.\n- Experimental gene therapies and peptides like bt101 are being explored as alternatives to [Clomid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clomifene), aiming to induce testosterone production from the brain without the negative feedback mechanisms.\n## How to Naturally Improve Testosterone [(01:18:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=4694s)\n- Adequate sleep and stress reduction are essential for natural testosterone production in men.\n- For men with low testosterone levels, it's crucial to address the underlying symptoms rather than solely focusing on increasing testosterone levels.\n- [DHEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone) is an effective supplement for women to increase testosterone levels and improve symptoms, with minimal risks at recommended doses.\n- LivMous offers a scientifically proven supplement that can enhance testosterone levels and improve overall performance.\n- The \"[NoFap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoFap)\" movement lacks clinical evidence to support its claim that frequent ejaculation negatively impacts testosterone levels or energy levels.\n## The 93 Year Old With a 40 Year Old Body [(01:24:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=5059s)\n- 93-year-old man with the fitness of a

hormone therapy.\n- His story is controversial, but it highlights the potential of lifestyle interventions to improve health and longevity.\n## Brian Johnson & the Longevity Movement [(01:27:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=5275s)\n- The longevity movement, biohacking, and health hacking aim to extend human healthspan and lifespan through various practices.\n- Focusing solely on death avoidance is futile as death is inevitable.\n- It is better to focus on healthspan, which includes factors like strength, bone density, and metabolic flexibility, rather than just lifespan.\n- The current ceiling for human longevity is around 123 years, but scientific advancements in areas like frailty and immune science could potentially extend it significantly.\n- There is no evidence to suggest that any supplement or simple method can dramatically increase human lifespan.\n- Cellular reprogramming to reverse aging is theoretically possible but not yet achievable with current technology.\n- The concept of \"longevity escape velocity\" suggests that advancements in medical technology could potentially extend human lifespan indefinitely.\n## The Supplements Everybody Needs [(01:37:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=5861s)\n- Magnesium is beneficial for muscle function, digestion, and cognitive function. Different forms of magnesium can be taken to target specific benefits.\n- Creatine monohydrate, at a dose of 5 grams daily, can help build muscle and improve performance. Higher doses may not be necessary and could cause digestive issues.\n- Methylated B vitamins and trimethyl glycine (TMG) can lower homocysteine levels, reducing the risk of dementia and cardiovascular disease. Natural folate and methylcobalamin (methylated B12) are recommended for regulating homocysteine levels.\n- Thumin (activated curcumin) is a more bioavailable form of curcumin.\n- The speaker recommends magnesium, creatine, methylated B vitamins (if needed), and cumin (especially thumin) for various health benefits.\n- During Achilles recovery, the speaker used TB500, [BPC 157](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPC-157), tart cherry juice, and other methods to reduce inflammation.\n- Blowing out one's Achilles during a pandemic can be advantageous due to the lack of other commitments, allowing for focused recovery.\n- The speaker expresses a fear of Achilles injuries due to the intense and prolonged recovery period required.\n## Getting Into Sport at an Older Age [(01:45:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=6308s)\n- To avoid injuries, reintroduce sports gradually after a long break, especially when transitioning to hard surfaces.\n- Calf injuries, such as a calf tear, can occur from sudden increases in physical activity and require a lengthy rehabilitation period of 12 to 24 months.\n- [Omega-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid) supplements, like Carlson's or Nordic Naturals, are beneficial for overall health and muscle recovery.\n- Dr. [Peter Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) emphasizes the importance of fish oil supplements for optimal health, recommending three potent fish oil pills daily with a fatty meal to enhance absorption.\n- Dr. Attia aims to maintain [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) and [DHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid) levels between 10% and 12% in his red blood cell membranes and suggests oysters as a delicious way to increase seafood consumption.\n## How Important is Water Quality? [(01:51:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=6664s)\n- Uses reverse osmosis filters that meet the standard for filtering out all [PFOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid).\n- Changes filters every six months.\n- Uses glass water bottles filled from the reverse osmosis filter.\n- Only drinks tap water when brushing teeth or taking pills.\n- Chemicals in plastics, such as PFOA, can have negative health consequences.\n- PFOA is found in drinking water in plastic bottles and contaminated city water.\n- [PFOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid) can also be found in [Teflon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene), fire-resistant clothing, and other products.\n- Plastics can leach [BPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A) into food and drinks, especially when heated.\n- BPA is an endocrine disruptor that can have negative effects on health, including declining testosterone levels in both men and women.\n- Microplastics in food packaging can also be a source of BPA and other harmful chemicals.\n## Impact of Hormonal Birth Control [(01:55:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=6903s)\n- The psychological impact of [hormonal birth control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_contraception) on women is not well-researched.\n- Hormonal birth control can cause a significant rise in [sex hormone-binding globulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin) (SHBG), which can lead to lower free androgen levels.\n- A recent [Scandinavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia) study found that 40% of [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) teenage girls have persistent or regular feelings of hopelessness.\n- It is possible that increasing levels of hormonal birth control usage may be contributing to the decline in female mental health.\n- There is some evidence that women's partner preferences and sexual satisfaction may change when they go on or off hormonal birth control.\n## Are There Real Risks to Suncream? [(01:59:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=7161s)\n- The safety of sunscreens is controversial, with some claiming they are dangerous and others arguing they are necessary to prevent skin cancer.\n- The relationship between sun exposure and melanoma is not entirely clear.\n- It is unclear if the risk of melanoma is increased by sun exposure that does not result in a burn, or if it has to result in a severe burn during a certain period of life.\n- The relationship between sun exposure and basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma is more clear, but these types of skin cancer are non-lethal because they cannot metastasize.\n- The podcast will explore the relationship between sun exposure and melanoma, and deep dive into the different types of sunscreens, including mineral versus chemical, and the real risks of each type.\n- Lipids and heart disease, dietary fats, and anything related to diet tend to be inflammatory topics due to their tribal and religious nature.\n- [Hormone replacement therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy) (HRT) used to be viewed as bad and dangerous by most of the medical establishment, but more doctors are now realizing that responsible HRT can be beneficial for women.\n- Vaccines are another controversial topic, with some people claiming they are dangerous and others arguing they are necessary to prevent disease.\n## The Rise of Vaccine Scepticism [(02:02:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=7372s)\n- The MMR vaccine is crucial for saving lives and has no proven link to autism.\n- The [CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention)'s handling of [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) has eroded public trust in vaccines.\n- The __[American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) Heart Association__'s decision to remove race as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease is politically motivated and lacks scientific evidence.\n- Prioritizing short-term emotional comfort over long-term health is a dangerous trend in medicine, as exemplified by the false claim that body weight has no impact on health and mortality.\n- Race does influence vulnerability to various health outcomes, and ignoring this fact can have adverse consequences for individuals' health.\n- Processed foods are not inherently unhealthy, and some, like venison sticks, can be nutritious.\n- Discussing food based on fundamental principles is more beneficial than using general labels like \"processed food.\"\n## The Panic About Ultra-Processed Food [(02:10:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=7840s)\n- Kellogg's was criticized for selling inferior versions of their products in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) compared to [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), raising concerns about certain colorants and ingredients.\n- Processed foods are often criticized for being unhealthy due to their convenience, taste, and affordability.\n- The speaker suggests healthier breakfast options for children, such as Cheerios with berries, yogurt, or applesauce, or a breakfast of bacon, sausage, eggs, and toast.\n- To maintain a healthy diet, the speaker limits their children's consumption of sugary and unhealthy foods, buys snacks in small serving sizes, and avoids keeping unhealthy foods readily available at home.\n## Debunking Myths Around WiFi & AirPods [(02:16:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=8207s)\n- [Peter Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) does not believe that [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) networks and [AirPods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods) have a significant impact on health.\n- He considers the focus on these issues to be a distraction from more important health concerns.\n- Attia suggests that people should focus on improving their overall health and fitness rather than worrying about minor factors like AirPods and Wi-Fi signals.\n- Attia criticizes the tendency of some people to become obsessed with specific health topics, such as the type of artificial sweetener in a beverage or the radiation emitted by AirPods.\n- He believes that these obsessions are often misplaced and that people should focus on more fundamental aspects of health, such as exercise and sleep.\n- Attia suggests that people should avoid getting caught up in online debates about minor health issues and instead focus on improving their own health and well-being.\n## Strategies for Sleep Quality [(02:20:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=8442s)\n- To optimize sleep quality, maintain a regular schedule, ensure adequate duration, and practice good sleep hygiene.\n- Improve sleep by increasing adenosine levels through physical activity, promoting melatonin production with a consistent circadian rhythm, and reducing cortisol levels by avoiding stress and using supplements like magnesium L3 inate and [Trazodone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trazodone).\n- Difficulty falling asleep may be due to going to bed too early, as some individuals have a natural tendency to be night owls.\n- Waking up throughout the night can be caused by sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, or underlying medical conditions.\n- Sleep problems can result from an incompatible sleep schedule, oversleeping, caffeine consumption, and nighttime awakenings.\n- [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy_for_insomnia) (CBTI) is effective in managing sleep difficulties, especially when waking up throughout the night.\n- Increased urination frequency during the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) pandemic may be due to changes in daily routines, leading to \"detraining\" of the bladder.\n- Retraining the bladder to increase its capacity can take up to six months and may involve medication and behavioral changes.\n- Anticholinergics, a medication for overactive bladder, can cause a significant decline in cognitive function, including memory loss and difficulty thinking.\n- Cognitive function is essential, and individuals experiencing cognitive decline face significant challenges.\n## Exploring Gut Health & Probiotics [(02:31:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=9069s)\n- Probiotics must be alive or freeze-dried to be effective, and a good probiotic is rich in [Akkermansia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkermansia) bacteria, which plays a role in butyrate production and glucose metabolism.\n- Insoluble fiber is crucial for gut health and should be consumed in large quantities.\n- Blending vegetables and fruits together, especially bananas, may impair the absorption of nutrients from other fruits, so it's best to s[epa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency)rate them in smoothies.\n- An [elimination diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elimination_diet), such as the FODMAP diet, can effectively identify food sensitivities, despite its restrictions, it still offers a variety of foods to choose from.\n## Motivation to Keep on Top of Health [(02:36:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=9394s)\n- Motivation and compliance are crucial for achieving long-term health goals.\n- Different individuals respond to various motivational strategies, such as data and rationality or emotions and relationships.\n- Perfectionism can be a harmful inner monologue that causes stress and pain, and it is often rewarded by society, making it difficult to break.\n- To motivate young people to prioritize their health and fitness, they should interact with older individuals to witness the effects of aging firsthand.\n- This interaction will help them understand that they are not immune to aging challenges and encourage them to take preventive measures.\n## The Conversation Around Female Ageing [(02:44:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=9841s)\n- Society views aging differently for men and women, with women seemingly more negatively affected.\n- Men may experience more regret as they age due to unresolved emotional issues from their youth.\n- Health span, encompassing physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being, is crucial in aging.\n- While physical and cognitive decline are inevitable, emotional health can improve with effort.\n- Accepting physical and cognitive decline while embracing emotional growth and self-improvement is essential.\n## Creating an Emotional Training Regime [(02:49:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=10181s)\n- Emotional training involves therapy and lifestyle choices that help individuals apply their learnings in practice, such as prioritizing loved ones' well-being and actively improving relationships.\n- Emotional training is a personal growth journey, similar to physical training transforming one's physique.\n- Individuals should be mindful of biases and avoid over-relying on their new emotional awareness.\n- Many people lack emotional connection and respect, leading to a lack of compassion towards others, especially online.\n- People often dehumanize individuals involved in public controversies or personal struggles, as seen in cases like [Jonah Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Hill)'s breakup and [Jordan Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson)'s benzodiazepine withdrawal.\n- It is crucial to recognize the humanity and emotions of others, even when their actions or situations are controversial or unpopular.\n## Should You Take Aspirin Every Day? [(02:58:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=10720s)\n- [Aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin), usually a baby aspirin (81mg), is sometimes prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in high-risk individuals.\n- Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, which can reduce clot formation and inflammation.\n- The benefits of taking aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention must be weighed against the risk of increased bleeding, particularly subdural or epidural hemorrhage, which is more common in older individuals with brain atrophy.\n## Why Nurses Are Underrated [(03:04:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=11046s)\n- Nurses spend more time with patients than doctors and often notice subtle changes in their conditions.\n- Nursing is a physically and emotionally demanding profession facing a shortage in the US.\n- The author shares a haunting story of a woman's sudden passing and reflects on the fragility of life and the impact of witnessing death as a medical student.\n- The author's book, \"Outlive,\" has received a positive response, with many readers changing their minds or behaviors based on the information provided.\n- The book emphasizes the importance of exercise, providing a comprehensive understanding of its significance and how to approach it effectively.\n- The final chapter and epilogue, though unplanned, have resonated with a significant portion of the readers.\n- Some readers find the exploration of various topics to be the most valuable part of the book, even if it doesn't immediately change their habits or perspectives.\n## If Peter Could Only Keep 10 Exercises [(03:13:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=11625s)\n- Dr. [Peter Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia) recommends choosing 10 exercises that can accommodate multiple variations for effective muscle building and longevity.\n- These exercises include cycling for different intensities and full-range training, rucking for joint loading and social interaction, and swimming for lifelong fitness and a full-body workout.\n- Belt squats are suitable for hip hinging without axial spine loading, while split squats are effective for single-leg training and can be varied for different muscle groups.\n- Dr. Attia also suggests compound exercises like barbell lunges, walking lunges, and dumbbell bench press, emphasizing axial loading and grip strength.\n- He recommends a three-grip pull-up, dumbbell bench press, and overhead tricep extension, avoiding exercises without humeral extension like tricep kickbacks.\n- Dr. Attia's top 10 favorite exercises include hanging leg raises for core and lower back, farmers carries for grip, core, and legs, and seated calf raises for lower legs and Achilles tendons.\n## Where to Find Peter [(03:27:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=12423s)\n- [Peter Attia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Attia)'s website (peterattiamd.com or earlymedical.com) is the best place to stay updated on his work.\n- Peter will be introducing quarterly reviews on his podcast, where he will share the most important things he learned from recent podcasts and how they changed his behavior.\n## Scientifically Proven Ways To Build Muscle & Boost Longevity - Dr Peter Attia (4K) [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hi8qOZB2qU&t=0s)\n- Peter Attia and the host have been cycling through virtual backgrounds for the past three and a half hours.\n- The host expresses his appreciation for Peter's work and his ability to make complex scientific information accessible to the public.\n- Peter mentions that he is excited about upcoming projects, including research on sunscreen and melanoma, and the introduction of quarterly reviews on his podcast.","## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=0s)\n- There is strong evidence for at least three mutants, calorie and methionine restriction diets, and some drugs, such as [rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus), delaying aspects of aging.\n- The host, Peter, introduces his guest for the podcast, expressing excitement for the discussion about longevity drugs and aging biomarkers.\n\n## An overview of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) [(00:00:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=50s)\n- The National Aging Institute created the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) about 20 years ago, now in its 20th year and applying for additional funding.\n- ITP tests drugs for their potential to slow aging and extend the lifespan of mice across three labs: the [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan), the [University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_Health_Science_Center_at_San_Antonio), and the [Jackson Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Laboratory).\n- Anyone in the world can nominate a drug for testing by the ITP, with an annual call for applications.\n- Four significant drug hits have been published by ITP, with two more showing smaller significant effects, and others soon to be published.\n- ITP goes beyond initial findings, testing varying doses, examining pathology, and sharing tissue samples with other researchers.\n- Insights from ITP could impact human aging research though there are many steps between successful mouse treatments and human drugs.\n- The number of drug candidate nominations varies each year; the record was 28 nominations, but typically it is 10-15, with about five to seven selected for testing.\n- The [National Institute on Aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Aging) (NIA) provides $1 million annually to each site involved in the ITP, with additional indirect costs for university maintenance and operations.\n- The NIA's budget for the ITP doubled from half a million after the first ten years, reflecting the program's success.\n- Although [NIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Aging)'s overall budget is significant due to its focus on Alzheimer's research, funding for aging biology as a general field is comparatively small.\n- Potential for philanthropic contributions exists as foundations can directly support research labs or projects at universities involved with the ITP.\n\n## How the mice used by the ITP are superior for research relative to mouse models used in most research [(00:08:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=531s)\n- The standard mouse model commonly used in research is the C57BL/6, known as the [B6 mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C57BL/6).\n- B6 mice have a single genotype, leading to limitations as drug effects can vary significantly between different mouse models.\n- Inbred B6 mice do not represent mice in general, despite widespread use in studies.\n- The Intervention Testing Program (ITP) uses a genetically heterogeneous mouse model called UM-HET3, which consists of mice sharing half of their genes randomly like siblings.\n- UM-HET3 mice can be consistently reproduced and have a diverse genetic variety, allowing for results less likely to be skewed by an unusual genotype.\n- This diversity in the UM-HET3 model can provide more reliable identification of drug effects and has enabled gene mapping related to lifespan.\n- The heterogeneity of UM-HET3 mice allows for a broader understanding of how inheritance modifies aging and drug response.\n- In contrast, B6 mice are homozygous, meaning they have identical genes from both parents, resulting in severe health issues and not being representative of a healthy population.\n- Inbred mouse models are mostly suitable for studying specific diseases they are prone to and for transplantation experiments where identical genotypes are necessary.\n- The continued use of B6 mice in research is often due to a lack of awareness of alternative models, financial constraints, and adherence to preceding research practices.\n- F1 mice, which are offspring of two different inbred strains, are healthier and live longer, serving as a better option for transplantation studies and as a foundation for creating models like the UM-HET3.\n\n## Design of ITP studies, outcomes tested, and metrics of interest [(00:17:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=1031s)\n- ITP studies test the effect of candidate molecules on aging after board review for biological plausibility.\n- Primary outcomes are calculated using the proportional hazard or risk of death over a lifespan, approximating median lifespan.\n- Median lifespan is the age by which half the population has died; increases are significant markers of longevity.\n- Maximum lifespan is assessed differently, using the 90th percentile survival rather than last mouse death to account for statistical variance.\n- Significant longevity effects are inferred when a higher percentage of surviving mice at the 90th percentile are drug-treated compared to controls.\n- The studies avoid choosing metrics based on the best outcome and pre-specify the 90th percentile to prevent false positives.\n- Power analysis is consistent across experiments with adequate planning to account for potential site-specific disasters.\n- Sample sizes at each site typically involve 100 males and 100 females for controls and 50 of each for treated groups, with controls being oversampled for comparison across drugs.\n\n## Variability and consistency across sites [(00:17:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=1031s) \n- Control mice survival rates are usually consistent across sites for females but not for males.\n- Males at the Michigan site consistently live 5-10% longer than those at other sites, with the cause still unknown.\n- Weight differences are also observed, with Michigan mice being about 10% lighter for both males and females, suggesting potential site-specific environmental factors.\n- The survival benefit of lighter weight is only evident in Michigan males, not females, and causality is unclear.\n- Site-specific differences in survival for males are managed by site stratifying comparisons of controls and treated mice within individual sites.\n- Results are then pooled, stratifying for both median and maximum lifespan metrics, but site-specific results are also reported separately in studies.\n\n## The process and challenges of drug formulation for mice [(00:29:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=1740s) \n- Ensuring proper drug formulation and dosing for mice involves significant planning and testing.\n- Randy Strong and Brett Ginsburg at the University of Texas focus on drug measurement in mice food and tissue.\n- Before starting lifespan experiments, food is tested with drugs to confirm proper dosage.\n- Testing involves checking MRNAs in the liver to ensure the drug's biological effect.\n- Issues, such as the degradation of drugs like rapamycin in the stomach, have been overcome with techniques like encapsulation.\n- Drug efficacy is impacted by factors like gender, as blood concentration differences can lead to variance in results.\n- Administration of drugs to mice is done through food, not intravenously or intramuscularly, due to practicality and mouse welfare.\n- Monitoring food intake is not precise since individual consumption rates cannot be tracked.\n\n## Four drugs identified by the ITP that extends the lifespan of mice [(00:36:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=2171s) \n- Over 100 drugs have been tested over 20 years, with some tested multiple times leading to notable successes and failures.\n- Rapamycin was the first molecule to prove lifespan extension in the ITP, with significant effects even when started late in life.\n- Other successful drugs include [17-alpha-Estradiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B1-Estradiol), [Acarbose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acarbose), and [Canagliflozin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canagliflozin), all of which have varying effects based on the sex and age at which they are started.\n- Not all drugs show equal efficacy in male and female mice, suggesting sex-specific metabolic processing of drugs.\n- Differences in xenobiotic metabolism between sexes account for drug concentration variations, a phenomenon also present in humans.\n- Despite known differences in male and female drug metabolism, human medicine does not typically use sex-specific dosing beyond weight differences.\n\n## The Success of Rapamycin and What It Tells Us About the Biology of Aging [(00:43:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=2612s)\n- Rapamycin (Rap) was nominated for ITP study by Dave Sharp, influenced by its FDA approval for organ transplants and emerging genetic data from invertebrates.\n- The initial interest in Rap was not due to its immune-suppressing properties but its role in controlling growth and its potential to extend lifespan.\n- The Immune functions of Rapamycin are dose and context-dependent, with both suppressive and boosting effects observed.\n- Unexpected findings showed that elderly mice treated with Rapamycin exhibited improved influenza vaccine responses due to enhanced B cell production.\n- The decision not to abort the study despite delays in formulating Rap for oral administration led to breakthrough findings.\n- In the study, both old and young mice treated with Rapamycin showed significant lifespan extension, with no significant difference when initiated in middle age compared to younger ages.\n- The effectiveness of Rapamycin in extending lifespan suggests a broader range of drug-sensitive aging processes still amenable to intervention even at middle age.\n- General positive health effects of treatment were observed, not just on lifespan but also on physical capabilities like grip strength and balance.\n\n## Other Measures of Healthspan Evaluated by the ITP in Stage 2 Studies [(00:51:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=3109s)\n- The ITP's next focus includes evaluating cognitive functions in mice treated with longevity drugs, a topic of divided predictions among researchers.\n- Healthspan measures being assessed in stage 2 studies include grip strength, motor tasks, stamina, muscle mass, and response to age-related diseases.\n- Stage 1 studies focus solely on lifespan and body weight, while stage 2 studies explore a broader range of health markers.\n- Specific interests in health markers drive the choice of additional measures at different labs.\n- An existing collaborative interactions program (CIP) enables sharing of tissue samples with external researchers but may be replaced by a centralized NIA system, potentially slowing down access to these resources.\n- Although the exact mechanisms and optimal tissue targets for studying drug effects remain unclear, tissues are actively being used for epigenetic and metabolomic studies, with the goal of eventually pinpointing precise cellular targets and pathways affected by anti-aging interventions.\n\n## Distinguishing aging rate indicators from biomarkers of aging [(00:59:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=3558s)\n- Biomarkers of aging are analogous to an odometer in a car, indicating the extent to which a body has \"aged.\"\n- Presently, there is skepticism about the existence or utility of robust biomarkers of aging.\n- Functional tests like strength, vision, and cardiovascular fitness can suggest biological youth, but these are not the same as assay-based biomarkers.\n- Aging rate indicators are compared to a speedometer, showing the rate of aging rather than the accumulated effects.\n\n## Aging rate indicators identified through the examination of slow-aging mice [(01:01:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=3676s)\n- Identified 13 biomarkers that change consistently across all examined slow-aging mouse models, including both genetically altered mice and those treated with specific diets or drugs.\n- Identified biomarkers are useful early indicators of aging rate, even when the mice are young adults.\n- One of the key biomarkers is [UCP1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermogenin), a mitochondrial protein that is associated with increased thermogenesis and has protective effects against obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and certain types of inflammation.\n- All slow-aging mice showed increased UCP1 levels in their fat tissues, with the exception of responses to certain drugs that only extend lifespan in male mice, suggesting sex-specific effects.\n- Discussed the variability in biological markers due to factors like exercise, diet, and time of day, but indicated that consistent differences between control and treated or mutant mice suggest a robust phenomenon.\n- Utilized humane euthanasia methods for mice to minimize stress-related artifacts in biological measurements.\n\n- Other key aging biomarkers identified in the slow-aging mice include a decrease in inflammatory macrophages (M1) and an increase in anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2), suggesting a reduction in inflammatory tone.\n- Increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor ([BDNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor)) and doublecortin (DCX) in the brain were observed, implying enhanced neuroprotection and neurogenesis, respectively. These changes were also sex-specific.\n- GPLD1 is another biomarker found to be elevated in slow-aging mice, which is involved in releasing proteins from cell surfaces and is associated with improvements in cognitive ability.\n- Slow-aging mice exhibited increased cap-independent mRNA translation, specifically for GPLD1, linking protein translation mechanisms to physiological effects observed in aging.\n\n## Why proteomics are essential to understand changes in the cell [(01:15:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=4536s)\n- [Proteomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics), the study of proteins, is crucial for understanding cellular changes because RNA levels are poorly correlated with protein levels.\n- Studies indicate only about 30% correlation between changes in RNA and proteins related to aging.\n- Changes in proteins with age are not fully explained by transcriptional changes.\n- The process of protein formation involves multiple steps beyond transcription, including translation and degradation, which can impact protein levels independent of mRNA.\n- Differential RNA translation and autophagy are among mechanisms that modify the proteome.\n- Recognizing the importance of these mechanisms will lead to greater emphasis on studying proteins and their nuances.\n\n## Unraveling aging rate indicators: dose-effect, duration, and future frontiers [(01:25:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=5130s)\n- Indicators of aging rate can potentially be influenced by genetic mutations, diet, and drugs.\n- Questions remain about how quickly aging indicators respond to interventions and how long effects persist.\n- Rapid changes in indicators would allow for screening large numbers of drugs to predict lifespan effects.\n- Past research shows that transient early-life treatment with growth hormone can have long-term effects on aging rate indicators.\n- Future research aims to understand whether positive interventions can have similarly persistent effects.\n- These aging indicators may also apply to human aging research, offering a potentially valuable tool for testing interventions in people.\n- Experiments with mice suggest that timing is crucial for interventions, with differing results depending on when growth hormone treatment is applied.\n\n## A closer look at aging rate indicators: bridging the gap from mice to humans [(01:31:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=5514s)\n\n- Biomarkers like BDNF and DCX are measured in mouse brains directly or in CSF.\n- For human application, less invasive methods than CSF or biopsies are desired, like plasma testing.\n- A [UCSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco) project gathered data including muscle and fat biopsies from healthy 70-year-olds, which will be used to look for aging rate indicators.\n- Two muscle and fat biomarkers relevant to fitness and aging, fndc5 and ucp1, are also measurable in human plasma.\n- Aim to find mouse and human plasma markers that correlate with tissue-specific aging rate indicators.\n- Study planned with Katherine Karowski and metabolic expert Costus Latas, to correlate blood metabolites with tissue aging markers in mice.\n- Hamilton at [Stanford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University) has developed a way to correlate plasma signals to specific organ changes; the methodology is not fully disclosed.\n- Irisin, a product from the muscle protein [FNDC5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FNDC5), correlates with slow aging in mice.\n- Previous irisin research had inaccuracies, but new assays have clarified its concentration and potential promise.\n- While irisin and gPLD1 seem promising, they would likely be injectable drugs due to their peptide nature.\n- Anti-aging drugs like rapamycin have demonstrated aging-delaying effects, but broader aging intervention requires strong evidence across various functions, not just anti-cancer properties.\n- There's increasing evidence that certain interventions act on aging broadly, not just one disease, challenging traditional medical perspectives. \n\n## Treatment efficacy and the holistic approach to slowing aging\n\n- Drugs must not only extend life but improve multiple age-sensitive functions to be considered true anti-aging drugs.\n- Evidence for a drug's anti-aging properties requires comprehensive testing, as seen with Snell dwarf mice and various diets.\n- Molecules like [rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus) are starting to build a strong case for genuinely slowing the aging process.\n- Anti-aging research is gradually shifting understanding from targeting specific diseases to a more holistic approach to health and longevity.\n\n## What do laboratory mice die from? [(01:44:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=6272s) \n- Laboratory mice predominantly die from cancer; approximately 80% succumb to various neoplasms.\n- Lymphoid or leukemia cancers are common in males, whereas females often die from breast or liver cancer.\n- Other kinds of cancers spread across the remaining 20% cause mortality in both sexes.\n- Necropsy data is usually too limited to statistically confirm if treatment-induced survival extension changes specific cancer proportions.\n- A notable exception was a drug that extended lifespan but didn't alter the age at death from breast cancer in females, hinting at complex drug-aging interactions.\n\n## Distinguishing between a drug that improves an age-sensitive outcome and a drug that improves all aspects of aging [(01:48:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=6489s) \n- No drugs have been found that improve health metrics like grip strength or treadmill time without also extending lifespan in the Interventions Testing Program (ITP).\n\n## The ITP study of 17α-estradiol: mechanisms of life extension and surprising sex differences [(01:48:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=6528s) \n- The ITP had success with 17α-estradiol, a stereoisomer of [17β-estradiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol) (common estrogen), which does not bind well to typical estrogen receptors.\n- It was hypothesized that since estrogens are beneficial, 17α-estradiol, without causing feminization, might improve male longevity.\n- Unexpectedly, 17α-estradiol extended male mouse lifespan beyond females, with no positive effect on female longevity, suggesting a different mechanism than typical estrogen.\n- Its physiological targets and actions remain largely unknown.\n- Research is underway to understand 17α-estradiol's effect, especially on the brain, with only a few labs currently investigating.\n- When combined with another drug, rapamycin, male mouse lifespan increased by 29%, but 17α-estradiol has not achieved more than a 19% increase alone.\n- Experiments are testing if combining 17α-estradiol with rapamycin will have additive effects.\n- A related compound, [hydroxy estriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16%CE%B1-Hydroxyestrone), has shown efficacy in males equivalent to or better than 17α-estradiol, while being the first drug to reduce female lifespan.\n- Males, but not females, showed an increased production of estriol when treated with 17α-estradiol, dependent on testosterone or another testicular hormone.\n- The reasons for choosing hydroxy estriol for study and the specific impact on mortality in females are under investigation.\n\n## Unsuccessful drugs studied by the ITP: resveratrol, metformin, and nicotinamide riboside [(01:58:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=7114s)\n- The Interventions Testing Program (ITP) revealed that [resveratrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resveratrol), [metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin), and [nicotinamide riboside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside) (NR), popularly believed to be effective anti-aging drugs, did not show the expected results.\n- These drugs garnered significant attention in the media and at conventions, with resveratrol particularly being associated with anti-aging properties supposedly found in red wine.\n- However, the effective concentration of resveratrol in red wine for anti-aging is impractically high, and its status as an activator of certain longevity pathways is disputed by biochemists.\n- Metformin, while safe for human use, did not extend lifespan in mice according to ITP studies and follow-up research.\n- NR generated a lot of hype but ultimately failed to extend mouse lifespan in ITP testing. It has been proposed that [NR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_riboside) or its metabolite, NMN, may still hold promise if combined with other substances or tested in different formulations.\n- Even though these substances were unsuccessful in mice, there's a possibility they may have different effects in humans, but robust testing in humans would be required to determine their efficacy.\n\n## Over-the-counter successes in the ITP: meclizine and astaxanthin [(02:09:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=7753s)\n- [Meclizine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meclizine), an over-the-counter seasickness drug, has shown a 10% increase in lifespan in male mice but not in females.\n- The intervention's effectiveness may not be directly linked to its properties as a TOR inhibitor but could be related to other CNS effects.\n- [Astaxanthin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astaxanthin), known for giving salmon their pink color and available over the counter, also improved longevity in male mice, but had no impact on maximum lifespan.\n- These findings are significant as they suggest over-the-counter drugs could affect aging, presenting new possibilities for mechanistic exploration.\n\n## A senolytic drug, fisetin, fails to extend lifespan [(02:16:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-krUa6VH0&t=8160s)\n- [Fisetin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisetin), a drug undergoing human trials as a potential senolytic, did not extend lifespan in male or female mice nor did it remove senescent cells.\n- Different dosage regimes suggested by experts were tested without effect, questioning the notion that fisetin can remove senescent cells.\n- The definition of what constitutes a senescent cell is unclear and debated, which complicates understanding the effectiveness of senolytics."]
